If a maintenance release later than what is recommended below is available for download, review the \"Resolved\n                           Caveats\" section in the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Release Notes and Cisco NX-OS Security Advisories to determine if any resolved caveats are applicable to your deployment scenario and feature set and upgrade to the later\n                           release to benefit from the incremental fixes. General\n               \t Recommendation for New and Existing Deployments We recommend you choose these release versions for new and existing Cisco Nexus 9000 Series deployments. Table 1. Recommended Releases for New and Exising Deployments Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches with... Recommended Release Version is... Hardware that is supported with NX-OS Release 10.4(x) 10.4(4)M Hardware that is not supported with NX-OS Release 10.4(x), but is supported with NX-OS Release 10.3(x) 10.3(6)M Hardware that is not supported with NX-OS Release 10.x 9.3(13) See the relevant release notes for the list of Cisco Nexus 3000/9000 hardware that is supported on a given Cisco NX-OS release. Refer Cisco Nexus 9000 and 3000 ISSU Support Matrix for the software upgrade path details. Note While performing multi-hop ND ISSU upgrade to higher releases, use 10.3(6)M or higher release as an intermediate hop. If the switch was previously upgraded using multi-hop ND ISSU and experiences unexpected CoPP drops open a TAC case to determine\n                                 if remediation is required. Note If you need to deploy software features that are only supported in 10.4(x), use the maintenance release of 10.4(x). Note PSIRT Fix Guidance: For customers on short-lived releases or previous recommended releases, we recommend that you look at the latest available\n                                 maintenance release of the Current recommended release to get up-to-date critical PSIRT fixes.

        "content": "What you will learn A comprehensive Cisco NX-OS Software release methodology has been developed both to preserve the integrity and stability of mission-critical networks and to have the flexibility to respond to market needs for timely delivery of advanced networking features with multilayer intelligence. This document is a guide to understanding the Cisco NX-OS Software release lifecycle. It describes the types of releases, their functions, and their timelines. It also describes the Cisco NX-OS Software release and image-naming conventions. Types of Cisco NX-OS Software releases Table 1 lists the Cisco NX-OS Software release variants: major+, major releases or trains, feature releases, and maintenance releases. Table 1. Cisco NX-OS Software release types Cisco NX-OS Software release type Description Major+ release A major+ release is considered a superset train, which carries all the attributes of a major release but can also have additional key changes (for example, 64-bit kernel) or other significant changes that require increasing the release numbering . A major+ release consists of multiple major releases. Example: Release 10.x(x) Major release A major release or software train introduces significant new features, functions, and/or hardware platforms. Each major release consists of multiple feature releases and maintenance releases and is its own train. Examples: Release 10.2(x), 10.3(x) Feature release Each major include will receive new features, functions, and hardware platforms in the first few releases (typically 3 releases) of the major train. These are designated as feature releases. Examples: Release 10.2(1)F, 10.2(2)F, 10.2(3)F Maintenance release Once a major train has reached maturity through the first few feature releases, it will then transition to the maintenance phase, where it will receive bug fixes and security enhancements only. No new features will be developed on a maintenance release, to ensure the integrity and stability of the overall major release train. Examples: Releases 10.2(4)M, 10.2(5)M, 10.2(6)M Each Cisco NX-OS Software release is uniquely numbered as A.B(C)x, where A is the major+ release or train, B is a major train that enhances a major+ release, C is the numerical identifier of the sequence within the major train and x represents if this release is a Feature release or a Maintenance release. Figure 1 is a graphical representation of the Cisco NX-OS Software releases, based on the example of the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches. Figure 1. Cisco NX-OS Software Lifecycle of a Cisco NX-OS Software release Previously, Cisco NX-OS releases were designated as either a long-lived or a short-lived release. From 10.2(1)F onwards, all major releases will be treated equally, and all major release trains will be designated as the recommended release at various points within their lifecycle. Figure 2 represents the lifecycle of the Cisco NX-OS 10.2(x) release. Figure 2. Lifecycle of a Cisco NX-OS software release The lifecycle of a Cisco NX-OS release goes through four phases. These phases also align with various stages in the End-of-Life (EOL) process. 1. The lifecycle of a major release starts with a feature development phase. This phase starts with First Customer Shipment (FCS) or the first release, on the major train. It represents the date of the first shipment of a software release to customers. There are two additional releases over the subsequent 12 months on this major train, where new features and enhancements are introduced. 2. At 12 months post FCS, the major release then enters the maintenance phase. This maintenance phase extends over 15 months, with regular software releases, where any potential defects or security vulnerabilities (PSIRTs) are addressed. No new features or enhancements are introduced during this phase, to ensure software stability. 3. At 27 months post FCS, it enters the extended support phase, under which it receives only PSIRT fixes. This date aligns with the End of Software Maintenance (EoSWM) milestone in the EOL process. 4. At 42 months post FCS, it enters the TAC support phase, where customers can continue to get software support from Cisco TAC, and an upgrade to a subsequent major release will be required for defect fixes. This date aligns with the End of Software Vulnerability/Security Support (EoVSS) milestone in the EOL process. At 48 months post FCS, no support will be provided for this major release. 5. For Nexus products running NX-OS software, customers will receive vulnerability (PSIRT) support through the hardware Last Day of Support (LDoS) milestone, on the final supported NX-OS release, Please see the hardware End of Life (EoL) announcement for specific milestones. Upgrade and migration Cisco NX-OS will continue to innovate across major releases while providing reliable and stable versions of NX-OS to our customers. A new major release will be launched in Q3 of each calendar year, enabling customers to take advantage of new features and hardware in this new major release while allowing other customers to remain on the previous major and recommended release, for those who want the reassurance of regular releases focused solely on defect fixes. The major release timelines and milestones are outlined below in Figure 3. Figure 3. NX-OS timelines across multiple releases NX-OS EoL Milestones Table 2. NX-OS EoL Milestones NX-OS Major Release EoSWM Date EoVSS Date LDoS 10.2(x) Nov 30 2023 Feb 28 2025 Aug 31 2025 10.3(x) Nov 30 2024 Feb 28 2026 Aug 31 2026 * 10.4(x) Nov 30 2025 Feb 28 2027 Aug 31 2027 10.5(x) Nov 30 2026 Feb 28 2028 Aug 31 2028 * 10.3.x release will be extended to support EX platforms till their Last Date of Support (LDOS). The extension on 10.3.x will only support EX platforms and not any other platforms that are supported on other 10.x.x releases. Conclusion The Cisco NX-OS cadence-based software release methodology preserves the integrity, stability, and quality of customers' mission-critical networks. It has the flexibility to respond to market needs for timely delivery of innovative features. The primary attributes of this release methodology include the following: ● Major releases introduce significant new features, functions, and platforms. ● Feature releases enhance NX-OS features and functions. ● Maintenance releases address product defects.

For new software features, see theCisco APIC 1.1(3f) Release Notes. The following procedure installs a Gigabit Ethernet module (GEM) in a top-of-rack switch: 1.Clear the switch’s current configuration by using thesetup-clean-configcommand. 2.Power off the switch by disconnecting the power. 3.Replace the current GEM card with the new GEM card. 4.Power on the switch. For other installation instructions, see theCisco ACI Fabric Hardware Installation Guide. ■Cisco NX-OS Release 11.1(3f) supports the hardware and software listed on the ACI Ecosystem Compatibility List and the Cisco AVS, Release 4.2(1)SV2(2.3). ■The breakout of 40G ports to 4x10G on the N9332PQ switch is not supported in ACI-Mode. ■To connect the N2348UPQ to ACI leaf switches, the following options are available: —Directly connect the 40G FEX ports on the N2348UPQ to the 40G switch ports on the ACI leaf switches —Break out the 40G FEX ports on the N2348UPQ to 4x10G ports and connect to the N9396PX, N9372PX, or N9372PX-E switches ■To connect the APIC (the controller cluster) to the ACI fabric, it is required to have a 10G interface on the ACI leaf. You cannot connect the APIC directly to the N9332PQ ACI leaf switch. ■The current list of protocols that are allowed (and cannot be blocked through contracts) include the following. Some of the protocols have SrcPort/DstPort distinction.

The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI Mode Release 11.0(3o) contains no new software. For installation instructions, see theCisco ACI Fabric Hardware Installation Guide. Follow this procedure when upgrading from a 1.0(2x) release to a 1.0(3x) release: 1.Upgrade the APIC controller software image. 2.After all APICs in the cluster are successfully upgraded, upgrade all the switches in the fabric. Note:The switches may need to be rebooted after upgrading (seeCSCut32029). Follow this procedure when downgrading from a 1.0(3x) release a 1.0(2x) release: 1.Downgrade the APIC controllers. 2.After all APICs in the cluster are successfully downgraded, downgrade the switches in the fabric. The 1.0(3o) release does not support a stateful downgrade to the 1.0(3f) release or an earlier release. To downgrade from 1.0(3o) to an earlier release, you must perform a stateless downgrade: 1.Export the configuration. 2.Downgrade to the earlier release 3.Import the configuration in that release. Note:Switch models N9K-C9372PX, N9K-C9332PQ, and N9K-C9372TX are not supported for downgrading in the APIC 1.0(3x) or the Cisco Nexus 9000 11.0(3x) releases. If your fabric has these models, do not downgrade. ■Cisco NX-OS Release 11.0(3o) supports the hardware and software listed on the ACI Ecosystem Compatibility List and the Cisco AVS, Release 4.2(1)SV2(2.3). ■The breakout of 40G ports to 4x10G on the N9332PQ switch is not supported in ACI-Mode. ■To connect the APIC (the controller cluster) to the ACI fabric, it is required to have a 10G interface on the ACI leaf.

Follow this procedure when upgrading from a 1.0(2x) release to a 1.0(3x) release: 1.Upgrade the APIC controller software image. 2.After all APICs in the cluster are successfully upgraded, upgrade all the switches in the fabric. Note:The switches may need to be rebooted after upgrading (SeeCSCut32029). Follow this procedure when downgrading from a 1.0(3x) release to a 1.0(2x) release: 1.Downgrade the APIC controller software image. 2.After all APICs in the cluster are successfully downgraded, downgrade all the switches in the fabric. Note:Switch models N9K-C9372PX, N9K-C9332PQ, and N9K-C9372TX are not supported for downgrading in the APIC 1.0(2x) or the Cisco Nexus 9000 11.0(2x) releases. If your fabric has those models, do not downgrade. ■Cisco NX-OS Release 11.0(3n) supports the hardware and software listed on the ACI Ecosystem Compatibility List and the Cisco AVS, Release 4.2(1)SV2(2.3). ■The breakout of 40G ports to 4x10G on the N9332PQ switch is not supported in ACI-Mode. ■To connect the APIC (the controller cluster) to the ACI fabric, it is required to have a 10G interface on the ACI leaf. You cannot connect the APIC directly to the N9332PQ ACI spine. ■The current list of protocols that are allowed (and cannot be blocked through contracts) include the following.

Follow this procedure when upgrading from a 1.0(2x) release to a 1.0(3x) release: 1.Upgrade the APIC controller software image. 2.After all APICs in the cluster are successfully upgraded, upgrade all the switches in the fabric. Note:The switches may need to be rebooted after upgrading (SeeCSCut32029). Follow this procedure when downgrading from a 1.0(3x) release to a 1.0(2x) release: 1.Downgrade the APIC controller software image. 2.After all APICs in the cluster are successfully downgraded, downgrade all the switches in the fabric. Note:Switch models N9K-C9372PX, N9K-C9332PQ, and N9K-C9372TX are not supported for downgrading in the APIC 1.0(2x) or the Cisco Nexus 9000 11.0(2x) releases. If your fabric has those models, do not downgrade. ■Cisco NX-OS Release 11.0(3k) supports the hardware and software listed on the ACI Ecosystem Compatibility List and the Cisco AVS, Release 4.2(1)SV2(2.3). ■The breakout of 40G ports to 4x10G on the N9332PQ switch is not supported in ACI-Mode ■To connect the APIC (the controller cluster) to the ACI fabric, it is required to have a 10G interface on the ACI leaf. You cannot connect the APIC directly to the N9332PQ ACI spine. ■The current list of protocols that are allowed (and cannot be blocked through contracts) include the following. Some of the protocols have SrcPort/DstPort distinction.

When upgrading from Release 1.0(1x) to Release 1.0(2x), you must upgrade the switch software image for all the spine and leaf switches in the fabric first. After that upgrade is successfully completed, upgrade the APIC controller software image. However, if you are upgrading within the Release 1.0(1x) software sequence or within the Release 1.0(2x) software sequence, you must first upgrade the APIC controller software image. And then, after that is successfully completed, upgrade all the switches in the fabric. Cisco NX-OS Release 11.0(2j) supports the hardware and software listed on theACI Ecosystem Compatibility Listand the Cisco AVS, Release 4.2(1)SV2(2.3).

This document includes the following sections: The Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) is an architecture that allows the application to define the networking requirements in a programmatic way. This architecture simplifies, optimizes, and accelerates the entire application deployment life cycle. TheCisco Application Centric Infrastructure Fundamentalsguide provides complete details about the ACI, including its two major components: TheCisco Application Centric Infrastructure Fundamentalsguide also includes a glossary of terms that are used in the ACI. Key features of the ACI include the following: A clustered replicated APIC appliance manages the ACI fabric. Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches can run with the ACI-compatible software to run in the leaf/spine fabric mode. These switches form a “fat-tree” network by connecting each leaf node to each spine node; all other devices connect to the leaf nodes.

When upgrading from a 1.0(1x) release to a 1.0(2x) release, you must upgrade the switch software image for all the spine and leaf switches in the fabric first. After that upgrade is successfully completed, upgrade the APIC controller software image. However, if you are upgrading within a 1.0(1x) release software sequence or within a 1.0(2x) release software sequence, you must first upgrade the APIC controller software image. And then, after that is successfully completed, upgrade all the switches in the fabric.

For more information, see Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS ePBR Configuration Guide, Release 10.5(x). Service Chaining with Security Groups Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.5(1)F, users can redirect traffic flows between endpoints part of different Security-Groups. With this release, there is support available for redirection to 1 node only. For more information, see Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS VXLAN Configuration Guide, Release 10.5(x). Exclude-L3-Proto in ECMP hashing Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.5(1)F, the exclude-l3-proto option is added to the ip load-sharing address command to allow the exclusion of the IP protocol from ECMP hashing during nexthop selection on Cisco Nexus 9300-GX2 Series switches. For more information, see Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Unicast Routing Configuration Guide, Release 10.5(x). Multi-thread support for YANG subscribe Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.5(1)F, multi-thread support for YANG subscribe is added. PIM Null register packing Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.5(1)F, you can configure Null-Register packing to send multiple multicast (S, G)s in one Null-Register packet and reduce the packet processing overhead in the PIM routers. UCMP (Unequal Cost Multi Path) Load balancing with BGP Extended Community attributes Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.5(1)F, DMZ Link Bandwidth feature is introduced to load balance traffic towards a BGP learnt route reachable through multiple autonomous system exit links. Advertise Remote prefixes with PIP as Next Hop instead of VIP Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.5(1)F, you can configure BGW to advertise external EVPN type-5 routes with PIP as next-hop and RMAC of PIP towards the fabric side. With this configuration, BGW uses PIP instead of VIP for route advertisement. Microsegmentation using VXLAN Group Policy Option: Enhancements Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.5(1)F, microsegmentation using VXLAN Group Policy Option will support additional match criteria, VLAN range and analytics for VXLAN packets carrying Group Policy Option. Support for microsegmentation will be available on Cisco Nexus 9408 switches. For more information, see Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS VXLAN Configuration Guide, Release 10.5(x). ECMP Dynamic Load-Balancing (DLB) on Nexus 9000 · ECMP Static Pinning · DLB Per packet load balancing. · VxLAN underlay – Tunnel Multipath Table on Cloudscale Until the current release, ECMP load balancing continues to be done using a hash created from fields in the packet. Thus, the load balancing decision is fixed based on values of the fields used to generate the hash. However, from Cisco NX-OS Release 10.5(1)F, along with the existing feature, the new Layer 3 ECMP Dynamic Load Balancing (DLB) feature provides support to efficiently load balance traffic depending on the current state of utilization of the outgoing links. The feature is supported with native layer 3, as well with VXLAN. The prominent features of Layer 3 ECMP DLB are as follows: · Faster convergence during link failures. · Maximize the utilization of available network paths. · Provide redundancy in case of link or node failures. · Minimize congestion by evenly spreading traffic across all paths. · Increase overall network performance without needing additional or specialized infrastructure. · Use Dynamic Rate Estimator (DRE)/DLB to allow better traffic load balancing in the fabric. · Support static-pinning where a source port can be pinned to a destination port which is part of a DLB Enabled ECMP Group. All the flows from the source port using a DLB ECMP group, which has the pinned destination port as member, are sent to the pinned destination port only. This feature provides two modes of load balancing: · The Flowlet Load Balancing (FLB) option provides for load balancing at the flowlet level. · The Per Packet Load Balancing (PLB) allows for traffic being distributed across the available links in a DLB ECMP and spread out, reducing the impact of large or long-lived flows on network congestion. Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.5(1)F, added support to enable Dynamic Load Balancing for underlay paths for VXLAN tunnels, allowing for ECMP routing on Layer 3 interfaces. For more information, see Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS VXLAN Configuration Guide, Release 10.5(x). Enhanced Software Features The enhanced features that are listed below are existing features that are introduced in earlier releases, but enhanced to support new platforms in Cisco NX-OS Release 10.5(1)F. Product Impact Feature Description Feature Set QoS FEX show commands Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.5(1)F, the show interface priority-flow-control commands are enhanced to display the PFC information for Cisco Nexus 9300-FX3 FEX Host Interfaces (HIF).

        "content": "Introduction The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Release Notes document describes the features, issues, and exceptions of Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(1)F software for use on Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. Note : The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product. Changes to this document: Date Description August 18, 2023 Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(1)F became available. New and Enhanced Software Features New Features Product Impact Feature Description Security VXLAN EVPN First Hop Security (IPv4) In the earlier releases, DHCP-snooping and associated security features such as Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) and IP Source Guard (IPSG) were restricted to a single switch. With Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(1)F, these features are supported on the entire VXLAN fabric. This allows a host that is authenticated on one VTEP to move to another VTEP through a trusted interface. See Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS VXLAN Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x). Radius over DTLS Support Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol is now used to  transport RADIUS datagrams over a secure channel using UDP. See Cisco Nexus 9000 NX-OS Security Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x). Ease of Use Port-channel load-balance command for MPLS tagged traffic The port-channel load-balance command for MPLS tagged traffic feature allows you to configure MPLS load-balancing as an option in the existing port-channel load-balance command. This feature provides for optimal load-balancing over port channel. See Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Interfaces Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x), and the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Label Switching Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x). Support to redirect/deny all packets using ePBR policy From Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(1)F, ePBR Layer 2 provides configuration options to redirect or deny all control traffic that match the ePBR policy to the service devices or service chain, without being consumed or intercepted. See Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS ePBR Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x), and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Security Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x). Split Loopback for VXLAN Multi-Site BGW Deployment The PIP interface now advertises orphan host route (using type 2 routes) with PIP as next hop before the hold-down timer expires. This avoids traffic loss for the orphan host and optimizes vPC convergence. See Cisco Nexus 9000 NX-OS VXLAN Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x). Feature Set VXLAN QoS Outer Header Policy for Layer 2 Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(1)F provides the default-vxlan-in-tnl-dscp-policy template in QoS policy-map type. This template matches the outer DSCP of the VXLAN packet and re-writes Class of Service (CoS) in the decapsulated ethernet packet on the egress VTEP. See Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS VXLAN Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x). Support ARP response for out-of-subnet With Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(1)F, you can enable or disable the ARP out-of-subnet packet transaction on the connected host using the ip arp outside-subnet command. This command is available in both global and interface modes. See Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Unicast Routing Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x). ePBR out-of-service This feature provides the ability to temporarily remove (shut down) an endpoint from service when a user-defined failure threshold is reached. The endpoints can be placed out-of-service by the following ways: ● Administrative out-of-service or ● Auto out-of-service See Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS ePBR Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x). Deduplication With Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(1)F, the deduplication feature allows you to remove duplicate copies of the traffic flow when used with Nexus Data Broker (NDB) switches. See Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS System Management Configuration Guide. Egress NetFlow Egress NetFlow identifies packet flows for outgoing IP packets and provides statistics based on these packet flows. The egress NetFlow uses ingress pipeline and ingress TCAM carving egr-netflow to record flow information egressing out of the switch. See Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS System Management Configuration Guide The enhanced features listed below are existing features introduced in earlier releases, but enhanced to support new platforms in Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(1)F. Enhanced Features Product Impact Feature Description Licensing Licensing support for Cisco N9K-C9804, N9K-C9348GC-FX3, N9K-C9348GC-FX3PH, and N9K-C9332D-H2R Smart Licensing using Policy is now supported on the following switches: N9K-C9804, N9K-C9348GC-FX3, N9K-C9348GC-FX3PH, and N9K-C9332D-H2R . See Cisco Nexus 9000 and 3000 Series NX-OS Smart Licensing Using Policy User Guide. Ease of Setup/Deployment Support for default boot mode change to LXC From Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(1)F, only the LXC mode is supported on Cisco Nexus 9300-FX and 9300-FX2 switches, which allows you to perform enhanced non-disruptive ISSU with minimal downtime. See Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Software Upgrade and Downgrade Guide, Release 10.4(x). Support for Enhanced ISSU on N9K-C9408 Enhanced ISSU is now supported on Cisco N9K-C9408 platform switch. See Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Software Upgrade and Downgrade Guide, Release 10.4(x). Security Keychain support for OSPFv3 A new option to enable keychain is provided for OSPFv3 encryption and authentication commands. See Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Unicast Routing Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x), and Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series NX-API REST SDK User Guide and API Reference for Release 10.4x. Certification based authentication on MACsec With Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(1)F, along with the existing pre-shared key option used for 802.1X port-based authentication, you also have the option to carry out authentication using the Extensible Authentication Protocol – Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) support, that is, certificate-based authentication on uplink ports where MACsec is required. See Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Security Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x). Secure POAP - CA group bundle This release allows you to use Root-CA bundles instead of single .pem certificate for Secure POAP. See Cisco Nexus 9000 NX-OS Fundamentals Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x). Ease of Use User mask position load-balance configuration options​ The ePBR load balance command is enhanced to include a new option, mask-position. With this option, you can choose the bits used for load balancing in user-defined ACL for IPv4 or IPv6 matches. See Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS ePBR Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x). Minimal disruptive fail-action for ePBR Layer 2 The ePBR Layer 2 fail-action feature is optimized to modify only the access control entries that are currently affected by the failure of the node. See Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS ePBR Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x). Feature Set Classify and rewrite packets based on outer DSCP at the egress VTEP The tunnel keyword is added to the match dscp command to match the outer DSCP value on the egress VTEP using an ingress service policy. See Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS VXLAN Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x). Support for port operators in ACLs Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(1)F provides ePBR Layer 3 policies, ePBR Layer 2 policies, and ITD services support Layer 4 port operators in match access-lists. This allows the Layer-4 port ranges and other port operations in the match access-list rules to be used for filtering traffic in the bucket access-lists. See Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS ePBR Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x), and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Intelligent Traffic Director Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x). Set outer DSCP for VXLAN encapsulated packets at ingress VTEP With this release, the tunnel keyword is added to the match dscp command to set the outer DSCP fields on the ingress VTEP. See Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS VXLAN Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x). VTEP co-existence with single-active ESI In the earlier releases, Cisco Nexus devices co-existed in a VXLAN fabric with switches that support ESI multi-homing in All-active mode but not in Single-active mode. With this release, Cisco Nexus Cloud Scale devices can coexist with switches that support ESI multi-homing in both All-active mode and ESI Single-Active mode. See Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS VXLAN Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x). BGP isolation mode to withdraw aggregate address routes With Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(1)F, you can configure isolation on route-map for the switches which are in maintenance mode. You can choose to either partially, completely, or customize the isolation. See Cisco Nexus 9000 NX-OS Unicast Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x). Support for load-balancing/redirection to nodes over tunnels ePBR and ITD support redirection or load-balancing on Layer 3 endpoints reachable over IP-IP and GRE tunnel interfaces. See Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS ePBR Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x) and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Intelligent Traffic Director Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x). Support tunnel interfaces With this release, ePBR and ITD support IPv4 and IPv6 policies on tunnel interfaces. See Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS ePBR Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x) and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Intelligent Traffic Director Configuration Guide, Release 10.4(x).

November 2, 2023 Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(4a)M became available New and Enhanced Software Features There are no new software features introduced in Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(4a)M. The enhanced features listed below are existing features introduced in earlier releases, but enhanced to support new platforms in Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(4a)M. Enhanced Features Product Impact Feature Description Feature Set Support for Enhanced ISSU on N9K-C9408 Enhanced ISSU is now supported on Cisco N9K-C9408 platform switch. See Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Software Upgrade and Downgrade Guide, Release 10.3(x). Scalability vPC port channel scale enhancements The vPC port channel scale is enhanced from 80 to 98 on Cisco Nexus 9300-FX2 switch and from 80 to 128 on Cisco Nexus 9300-GX2 switch. See Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Verified Scalability Guide, Release 10.3(4a)M. Note: Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(4a)M, the existing logging rfc-strict 5424 command (optional) that enables the syslog protocol RFC 5424 is enhanced by adding a new keyword (full ) as follows: logging rfc-strict 5424 full . The addition of this keyword ensures complete compliance with the RFC 5424 standard for Syslog Protocol. However, if the values are not available for the [APP-NAME] [PROCID] [MSG-ID] [STRUCTRED-DATA] fields, then the nil value is indicated by a dash (-). See Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS System Management Configuration Guide, Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Command Reference (Configuration Commands), and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS System Messages Reference, Release 10.3(x). Hardware Features There are no new hardware features introduced in Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(4a)M.

The 32-bit image is no longer supported. Open Issues Bug ID Description CSCwh76275 Headline: Nexus 9364-GX2A - Slice 0 discards Multicast traffic after RTP Flow Monitor is enabled. Symptoms: Nexus 9364-GX2A discards Multicast traffic after RTP Flow Monitor is enabled and continues to discard it even after RTP Flow Monitor is disabled. Workarounds : None. CSCwh88428 Headline: On Nexus 9000 switch, SNMP trap is not sent when Storm Control traffic falls below the threshold. Symptoms: A Cisco Nexus 9000 device can fail to send an SNMP trap when Storm Control traffic falls below the threshold and the following syslog is seen. However, trap is not seen. %ETHPORT-5-STORM_CONTROL_BELOW_THRESHOLD: Traffic in port Ethernet1/1 has fallen below the configured threshold, action – Trap. Workarounds : None. CSCwi92006 Headline: all interfaces shown input/output rate as 0pps on N9K FX2 platform Symptoms: all interfaces shown input/output rate as 0pps on N9K-FX2 platform without any operations. Impact is on N9K-FX2 switches and does not impact the N3K. Workarounds : None. Resolved Issues Bug ID Description CSCwf34104 Headline: SMU not installed after switch reload/panic/smu-install reload Symptoms: The symptoms are as follows: 1. Nexus 9000 Switch is running 10.3(3) and has any SMUs committed. Example: Swich_Name# show install committed Boot Image: NXOS Image: bootflash:///nxos64-cs.10.3.3.F.bin Committed Packages: nxos64-cs.CSCwf61602-1.0.0-10.3.3.lib32_64_n9000 committed 2. Committed SMUs may not be activated after reload due to power-cycle, software reload. Below command will show the SMU will be Inactive Committed (wrong signature) Switch_Name# show install patches Boot Image: NXOS Image: bootflash:///nxos64-cs.10.3.3.F.bin nxos64-cs.CSCwf61602-1.0.0-10.3.3.lib32_64_n9000 Inactive Committed (wrong signature) Workarounds: When Inactive Committed (wrong signature) is present, reload again to re-commit the SMU. CSCvw16064 Headline: NX-OS to be conformed with RFC 5424 (NILVALUE for STRUCTURED-DATA and MSGID fields) Symptoms: In all Cisco NX-OS versions, the implementation of syslog does not follow RFC 5424 leading to following problems: ● Adding NILVALUE for STRUCTURED-DATA field as we don't have structured data currently in syslog messages. RFC 5424:6.3.  STRUCTURED-DATA In case of zero structured data elements, the STRUCTURED-DATA field   MUST contain the NILVALUE. ● Adding NILVALUE for MSGID in syslog header as this must be there if no data is available for MSGID. For the rest fields like APP-NAME, PROCID NILVALUE is not mandatory. Workarounds: None CSCvz06811 Headline: Nexus Data Broker switch floods IGMPv3 membership queries out of all input ports. Symptoms: IGMP membership queries are flooded out of monitoring ports. IGMP storms (due to queries) are forwarded from Nexus Data Broker Switch to production network. Workarounds : Filter the IGMP with an access list. CSCwd75778 Headline: Unable to connect to gRPC port 50051 in non-default vrf. Symptoms: Unable to connect to gRPC port 50051 in non-default vrf with MPLS path. Telnet to port 50051 also fails. Workarounds: None CSCwd75851 Headline: /nxos/xlog is filled 100% with repeated copy run start and log files are not rolled over. Symptoms: When configuration changes are automated and multiple sessions try to save the configuration changes simultaneously and repeatedly, a syslog is seen. Workarounds: Avoid simultaneous configuration sessions and excessive/repeated config save operation. CSCwd41247 Headline: samcproxy is deadlocked with multiple Instances. Symptoms: Configuration or simple tasks such as turning on a locator LED do not complete. Multiple instances of samcproxy running are seen, and one is in a deadlocked state. There may also be other miscellaneous faults on the domain, due to samcproxy being in a bad state. Workarounds: Contact Cisco TAC for a workaround as this requires debug shell access. CSCwd77505 Headline: MAC Address Not Learned on Peer 6332 FI. Symptoms: The host experiences a failover event or the VM is migrated to a different host, and the network connectivity to that VM is lost. Workarounds: Contact Cisco TAC for workarounds. CSCwe20605 Headline: Encrypted tunnel (VXLAN Cloudsec) traffic is getting dropped on Cisco Nexus 9300-FX3 switch. Symptoms: After upgrading Cisco Nexus 9300-FX3 switch to Cisco NX-OS Release10.3(2)F image, few or all encrypted tunnel traffic is dropped. VXLAN Cloudsec or tunnel encryption statistics do not update. Workarounds: The workaround is as follows: 1. Remove tunnel-encryption from DCI uplinks . 2. Copy running-config startup-config. 3. Reload the switch. Post reloading, configure tunnel-encryption on DCI uplinks. CSCwe43450 Headline: Unexpected Kernel panic post ISSU from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(6) to 9.3(9). Symptoms: After ND-ISSU from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(6) to 9.3(9), an unexpected reload due to kernel panic is noticed in POE devices. This symptom can be verified by running either the sh logging onboard internal reset-reason command or the sh system reset-reason command. The output shows Reset Requested due to Fatal Module Error. Workarounds: None CSCwe81696 Headline: 100M links with the use of GLC-T/GLC-TE transceivers do not come up in Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(4), 10.2(5), and 10.3(2). Symptoms: Links with 100M speed do not come up and remain in a Link not connected status. Workarounds: None CSCwf12345 Headline: Seeing intermittent traffic drops during ND_ISSU for 4-5 seconds for FCoE hosts. Symptoms: During non-disruptive upgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(1) or 10.3(2) to 10.3(3), intermittent traffic disruption is seen on FCoE hosts. Traffic switches over to available alternate path and then switches back. Workarounds: For upgrades from Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(1)F or 10.3(2)F to 10.3(3)F, you can configure the holdtimer in LLDP to be of 255 (max value) using the following global command and then initiate upgrade: lldp holdtime 255. CSCwf21754 Headline: After the reload ascii command, VRF ID always points to default when traffic flow is through the SVI interface. Symptoms: When the Cisco Nexus 9500 switch is reloaded with the reload ascii command, the NetFlow export sends ingressVRF-id as defa...",

Symptoms: When TTL-Security is enabled, BGP Externall-Fallover does not bring down the eBGP session as soon as the physical interface (Eth1/47) is down. Instead, BGP is waiting for the hold timer to expire (which has been configured to be 20 secs). Workarounds: Disable TTL-Security. CSCwe43450 Headline: Tahusd Crash caused unexpected reload post ISSU from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3.6 to Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3.9 Symptoms:  Unexpected reload with the following reason: # sh logging onboard internal reset-reason ---------------------------- Module:  1 ---------------------------- Switch OBFL Log:  Enabled Last log in OBFL was written at time Tue Feb 21 18:40:02 2023 Reset Reason for this card: Image Version : 9.3(9) Reset Reason (LCM): Unknown (0) at time Mon Feb 20 22:37:39 2023 Reset Reason (SW): Reset Requested due to Fatal Module Error (4) at time Mon Feb 20 22:35:26 2023       >>>>>>>>>>>>>> Service (Additional Info): SAP:1428 Reset Reason (HW): Kernel Reboot (1) at time Mon Feb 20 22:37:39 2023 Workarounds: Not Applicable CSCwe46297 Headline: Nexus 9000 silent reload by \"Watchdog Timeout.\" Symptoms: The N9K-C9504-B3-G device running 10.2.4.M version code unexpected reloads by \"Watchdog Timeout.\" Workarounds: None CSCwe50502 Headline: NX-OS Unexpected Reloaded due to Watchdog with high ASIC interrupt counters Symptoms: Nexus 9000 device unexpectedly reloads with \"Watchdog Timeout\" reason and without generating core files under \"show cores\", due to a large number of ASIC interrupts. Workaround: None. The only way for the device to recover from the influx of interrupts is to reload. CSCwe51952 Headline: Transient loop in BiDir multicast segment observed during change of DF Symptoms: Short burst of BiDir multicast traffic during DF change Workaround: None CSCwe41327 Headline: SYSMGR-3-CFGWRITE_FAILED: Configuration copy failed due to 100% usage of startup-cfg Symptoms: Nexus switches may fail to save the config to startup config due to frequent changes to the ACL config with below errors: 2023 Feb 10 13:17:11.746 N3k %PSS-0-PSS_WRITE_DATA_FAILURE: aclmgr: failed to write data to /var/sysmgr/startup-cfg/bin/aclmgr_start_cfg_user block 8785: partial write 2023 Feb 10 13:17:11.746 N3k%PSS-0-PSS_WRITE_DATA_FAILURE: aclmgr: failed to write data to /var/sysmgr/startup-cfg/bin/aclmgr_start_cfg_user block 8785: partial write (message repeated 1 time) 2023 Feb 10 13:17:11.746 N3k %PSS-0-PSS_WRITE_FAILURE: aclmgr: failed to write data: Operation not permitted 2023 Feb 10 13:17:11.760 N3k %SYSMGR-3-CFGWRITE_SRVFAILED: Service \"aclmgr\" failed to store its configuration (error-id 0x4048000C). 2023 Feb 10 13:17:11.927 N3k %SYSMGR-2-CFGWRITE_ABORTED: Configuration copy aborted. 2023 Feb 10 13:17:14.017 N3k %SYSMGR-3-CFGWRITE_FAILED: Configuration copy failed (error-id 0x401E0000). switch# show system internal flash | in Mount|startup Mount-on                  1K-blocks      Used   Available   Use%  Filesystem /var/sysmgr/startup-cfg      102400     90632       11768     89   none switch# Workaround: Avoid the growing usage of startup-cfg by making configuration changes without config session/commit. Once startup-cfg usage hits 100%, the configuration save to startup will fail. Recovery is by switch reload. The running configuration can be saved to bootflash if additional configuration can't be saved to the bootflash. CSCwe55237 Headline: Nexus: Configuring overlapping IPv6 address with different mask on L3 interface does not throw error. Symptoms: If IPv6 address is configured, which is overlapping on two different L3 interfaces of the same box using different subnets, no warning message is seen. This is not the case for IPv4. Workaround: Use a subnet calculator to ensure the addresses are not overlapping. CSCwe53655 Headline: Revert reserved mac blocking behavior for VRRP macs on SVIs Symptoms: User will not be able to configure VRRP macs on SVI interfaces. Workaround: None CSCwe07768 Headline: Nexus 9000 BFD packets placed in the default queue Symptoms: BFD packets are being put into the default queue, which can cause BFD neighbors to flap when there is buffer congestion.

CSCwh50989 Headline: Custom COPP causing transit traffic to be punted to the CPU on Nexus 9300-GX2 Symptoms: When custom-COPP policy contains ACL rules which match on Layer 4 destination or source port, transit traffic also hits the COPP and the packets are copied to CPU. This causes duplication of traffic as CPU also routes the copied packets to the destination. Workarounds: Custom COPP policy using src/dst match mitigates punt for transit traffic. Resolved Issues Bug ID Description CSCwd03152 Headline: VLAN Mapping issue and STP inconsistency with single leg VPC Symptoms: When Nexus 9000 switches running on version 9.3(9) in vPC connects to a downstream access switch; with single link switch is running VXLAN and vPC port channels has PV mapping configuration; STP state of configured vPC port channel (even though port is in shut state) will be in forwarding state. Translated VLAN in downstream access VLAN will be in broken state due to the receipt of wrong BPDUs. Workarounds: Enable both links from vPC primary and secondary towards access switch. CSCwd21451 Headline: SNMP walk on any OID does not return with expected results Symptoms: SNMP walk on any OID does not return with expected results. Example: ipAdEntAddr IP-MIB or OID returns only 2 IPs even though multiple IPs are configured: server-host% snmpwalk -v 2c -c '***' pnq16-co-agg-r2 IP-MIB::ipAdEntAddrIP-MIB::ipAdEntAddr.10.130.96.4 = IpAddress: 10.130.96.4IP-MIB::ipAdEntAddr.10.130.96.65 = IpAddress: 10.130.96.65 Workarounds: None CSCwe11348 Headline: Telemetry memory limit reached dropping collection Symptoms: Telemetry stops working on N9K-C93180YC and N9508Nexus reports memory occupied exceeds the limit allowed and syslog \"telemetry memory limit is reached\" is generated. Workarounds: · Remove telemetry feature configuration using “no feature telemetry” command. · Wait for 3 minutes for the process to gracefully exit. · Remove HTTP destination configuration and reapply telemetry configuration. The telemetry HTTP configuration can be re-applied later once HTTP destination is stable. CSCwe30433 Headline: IP packets with IP option not routed after reload Symptoms: Ping with IP option will not be routed on configured Nexus 9500 series switches if the switch comes up just after reload. When packets are not routed, \"Ingress ICMP Redirect processing drop\" in \"show ip traffic\" is counted up. Workarounds: If you have standby supervisor, switchover the supervisor. The issue will not be seen. Note that if switch comes up with no configuration, this issue will not be observed just after configuring switch for routing. Issue will be seen after reload with saved configuration. CSCwc87548 Headline: Underrun errors transmitted when upgrading from 40 to 100 Gbps on a Nexus 9000 EOR. Symptoms: When the SFP is replaced to support 100G (QSFP-100G-SR4) or by changing the speed of the port (QSFP-40/100-SRBD), underrun packets are transmitted. However, output err...",

This image is supported on Cisco Nexus 9000 -R and -R2 series modular switches. The 32-bit image is no longer supported. Open Issues Bug ID Description CSCwa77878 Headline: Default MTU shown in running-config when non-default value configured under network-qos class-map. Symptom: When configuring non-default values (dpp, pause, and so on) under class-map in network-qos policy-map, default MTU \"mtu 1500\" is shown in show running-config and cannot be deleted by \"no mtu 1500\". Default value should not be shown in show running-config. Workaround: None. Note that this is just showing default value in running-config and no impact to switch functionality. CSCwc08911 Headline: Nexus 9000 :: dot1dBasePortIfIndex (.1.3.6.1.2.1.17.1.4.1.2) OID is not initiated properly on device reload. Symptom: The OID dot1dBasePortIfIndex (.1.3.6.1.2.1.17.1.4.1.2) is not available on Nexus 9000 series switch. Workaround: ● (config)# no snmp-server load-mib dot1dbridgesnmp ● Try killing the snmpd process: \"run bash sudo killall snmpd\" (requires \"feature bash-shell\") CSCwc45694 Headline: TapAgg: 9300-GX - vlan tag is missing on captured packets with reload ascii. Symptom: On 9300-GX series switch, ASCII reload vlan tag is missing on the egress interface when TapAgg is configured to redirect traffic. Workaround: Remove and reapply \"mode tap-aggregation\" configuration under the interface. CSCwc95871 Headline: Cisco Nexus 9200/9300 EOR switches: Unable to config switch mode trunk on FX breakout interface after replacing EX LC. Symptom: When N9500 line card module is removed and new line card is replaced, re-application of interface config on some breakout interfaces such as second breakout interface is not possible. Workaround: Reload the whole system to refresh interface dme running-config to re-apply breakout config and old running config for the new line card. CSCwd20332 Headline: Ethernet port is breaking out without even giving breakout configs. Symptom: Interface breakout commands are not cleaned up on write erase + reload and POAP abort. Workaround: POAP abort is a negative scenario, circumvent the entire POAP abort by using the system no poap command. POAP can be aborted at any other stage such as, during breakout, during v4 DHCP phase, during v6 DHCP phase, and so on, and this issue does not occur. CSCwe67205 Headline: Credit Loss Recovery is not triggered for FC interface with no transmit credits. Symptom: A Fibre Channel interface that stays at 0 transmit credits is not recovered by the Credit Loss Recovery agent. Workaround: If the interface has switchport ignore bit-errors configured, then remove it with the no switchport ignore bit-errors interface configuration command. CSCwe53655 Headline: Revert reserved MAC blocking behavior for VRRP macs on SVIs Symptoms: User is not able to configure VRRP VMAC on SVI interfaces. Workarounds: None. CSCwh50989 Headline: Custom COPP causing transit traffic to be punted to the CPU on Nexus 9300-GX2 Symptoms: When custom-COPP policy contains ACL rules which match on Layer 4 destination or source port, transit traffic also hits the COPP and the packets are copied to CPU. This causes duplication of traffic as CPU also routes the copied packets to the destination. Workarounds: Custom COPP policy using src/dst match mitigates punt for transit traffic. Resolved Issues Bug ID Description CSCuq79793 Headline: IPv6 ND processes NA with Link-layer address 0000.0000.0000 as valid. Symptom: IPv6 ND installs a neighbor entry for an IPv6 host that sends an NA with the Link-layer address field populated with mac address 0000.0000.0000. Workaround: None CSCvx84922 Headline: Interim ACL rule programmed during non-atomic update is not functioning as expected on all Nexus 9000 Cloudscale ASICs. Symptom: An issue with non-atomic updates of Access Control Lists (ACLs) on Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches may result in traffic being permitted instead of denied during the brief time interval required for the device to update an ACL. Workaround: None. This issue only affects the brief time interval required for the non-atomic update of the ACL and the expected ACL behavior is enforced after that. CSCvx93145 Headline: Topology information is not propagated from ISIS to MPLS TE when authentication is configured for ISIS. Symptom: The following symptoms are seen: ● MPLS TE topology (show mpls traffic-eng topology) contains no information on other expected nodes, including those that are present in ISIS topology. ● Similar logs are seen in \"show isis event-history te\". Workaround: Configure ISIS authentication on per-interface level and remove it from the router isis section. CSCvz01927 Headline: ARP process crash Symptom: ARP process crash Workaround: Do not run the show ip arp vrf XXX commands too often to reduce the associated risk. CSCvz17681 Headline: Snapshot creation permission is denied. Symptom: Snapshot creation may fail with \"Error:13(Permission denied)” when different users with different roles were used to create snapshots previously. Workaround: None CSCvz38944 Headline: Nexus 9000 DHCPv6 Relay breaks after IPv6 snooping is removed. Symptom: Original Symptom from DHCPv6 Client perspective is not receiving an IPv6 Address from the DHCPv6 server.

The issue is seen only under below circumstances VPC boxes are running in MST mode. Xconnect configuration is inconsistent between VPC peers. Xconnect access ports are up. After the configuration is completed/corrected on both sides of the VPC peers, the STP and traffic issues goes away. Workarounds: Keep the Xconnect ports in shut state on all VTEPs during configuring/unconfiguring Xconnect  on the associated vlans. This is to make sure that switch does not receive customer STP BPDUs causing STP churn on unrelated vlan. CSCvx77167 Headline: Xconnect vlan deletion/bringup via DME fails Symptoms: Configuring Xconnect along with vlan create and vn-segment mapping in a single request message via REST, does not enable xconnect. Workarounds: User can configure Xconnect in a separate REST message. Vlan create and vn-segment  can be configured together in a single request.

        "content": "Introduction This document describes the features, issues, and exceptions of Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(13) software for use on Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. Note: The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product. Date Description April 25, 2024 Added CSCwh50989 to Open Issues. December 18, 2023 Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(13) became available. New and Enhanced Software Features There are no new or enhanced software and hardware features introduced in Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(13). Open Issues Click the bug ID to access the Bug Search tool and see additional information about the bug. Bug ID Description CSCvx62127 Headline: LICMGR crashes continuously and device reboots post issuing cli \"sh lic all\". Symptoms: On upgrading the licmgr crashed continuously four times and hap_reset is triggered causing DUT to reboot. This happened on execution of CLI : \"show license all\" 2021 Mar 9 09:01:38 switch %$ VDC-1 %$ %SYSMGR-2-SERVICE_CRASHED: Service \"licmgr\" (PID 20292) hasn't caught signal 11 (core will be saved). 2021 Mar 9 09:01:38 TECTAE-PGBL-89 %$ VDC-1 %$ %SYSMGR-2-SERVICE_CRASHED: Service \"licmgr\" (PID 28524) hasn't caught signal 11 (core will be saved). 2021 Mar 9 09:01:38 TECTAE-PGBL-89 %$ VDC-1 %$ %CALLHOME-2-EVENT: SW_CRASH 2021 Mar 9 09:01:39 TECTAE-PGBL-89 %$ VDC-1 %$ %SYSMGR-2-SERVICE_CRASHED: Service \"licmgr\" (PID 28606) hasn't caught signal 11 (core will be saved). Workarounds: Change the host name so that it does not have any special characters. CSCwf54392 Headline: The \"radius-server key <>\" missing after ND ISSU. Symptoms: When upgrading a Nexus 9000 switch from a code where LXC boot mode is not the default mode, to one where it is, using non-disruptive ISSU, the \"radius-server key 7 <string>\" configuration can go missing. This is due to to the change in default boot mode. Workarounds: Remove and reapply the missing CLI string to reconfigure and ensure it is consistent between configuration and DME. CSCwf08452 Headline: Lag in entering commands in 93360YC-FX2. Symptoms: Most of the ports on these switches are populated with GLC-TE Transceivers.  Any changes to the port configurations usually cause very long delays (minutes). This could be from a 'switchport' or 'shut/no shut' command. Have experimented with 'spanning-tree port type edge' and explicitly setting the speed on the port, but issues are still occurring. The switch also seems to take a very long time to recognize a new physical connection or GLC-TE reseat. GLC-TEs are supported on this model according to the matrix page. Workarounds: Use ‘no QOS statistics’. CSCwf37269 Headline: Nexus 9000 Cloud Scale switches with mix of static and dynamic queue-limit drops low-rate traffic. Symptoms: 1. Egress interface reports incrementing output discards despite a low rate of traffic destined for that interface. 2. Incrementing occupancy drops under PG-Drop pool (slot X show hardware internal tah buffer counter). 3. The queue depth remains at 0 byte for the affected Egress interface (show queuing interface), which means that there is no actual congestion for that interface. 4. When sufficiently *reducing* the static queue-limit configuration or the number of ports configured with static queue-limit, under the same traffic conditions, output discards for the affected interface stop. Workarounds: Use ‘dynamic queue-limits’. CSCwh02830 Headline: Manual power cycle required after upgrading N9K-C9500 switch NXOS EPLD with SUP A+/SUP B+ V02 Symptoms: 1. Nexus 9500 chassis with single or dual SUP A+ or B+ HW V02 2. Upgrade of Sup or SC EPLD (Just NXOS upgrade will not trigger this issue.) 3. After the reload, the active SUP module does not boot up all the way and appears to be stuck with no console output and a continuously blinking amber STS LED. Workarounds: 1. Physically re-seat the module (cold power-cycle). 2. Remove all power to the chassis to allow the SUP module to power up again. CSCwh72222 Headline: ARP request dropped by ARP Suppression in traditional VLAN Symptoms: ARP requests of hosts in a Non-VXLAN VLAN are dropped in the VTEP switch due to ARP suppression. Additionally, ARP request packets can be captured in CPU with Ethanalyzer tool, even though the VLAN does not have an SVI. Workarounds:  Configure an SVI for the affected VLAN. SVI can be shut down and does not need an IP address or reload the switch. CSCwd13172 Headline: Nexus 9000 FX2 multicast-tx span is not working. Symptom: 1. Multicast traffic is not mirrored from the configured source interface or 2. Multicast traffic would be mirrored from incorrect source interface or 3. Not a configured interface. Workarounds: None CSCwi45695 Headline: During BIOS downgrade, N9K-X96XX modules may experience time-out. Symptom: BIOS downgrade for N9K-X96XX linecard modules may report failure due to time-out. Module 3: Refreshing compact flash and upgrading bios/loader/bootrom. Warning: please do not remove or power off the module at this time. [####################] 100% -- FAIL. Return code 0x40820011 (Job timedout). CAUTION: The BIOS/loader/bootrom of above module may be in corrupted state. Please try programming it again. Workarounds: If 'show install all impact ...' indicates a lower BIOS version than that currently installed on the module, avoid using the 'bios-force' flag during install operations. CSCwi44292 Headline: Pre-upgrade check on nxos64-msll images does not display new BIOS version correctly during downgrade. Symptom: During downgrade from impacted NXOS version to a previous version, pre-upgrade check displays New BIOS version as blank on following impacted platforms Impacted Software version:10.4(2),9.3(13) Impacted Platforms: -N3K-C36180YC-R -N9K-X96XX  with N9K-X9636Q-R,N9K-X9636C-RX, N9K-X9624D-R2,N9K-X96136YC-R line cards Workarounds: None CSCwi36291 Headline: QSFP-100G40G-BIDI higher linkup time issue Symptom: Sometimes link up time may be higher on N9K-C9364C (port 49-64) or N9K-C9332C (port 25-32) when using QSFP-100G40G-BIDI optics. Workarounds:  Use other ports on these PIDs or switch to another type of optics. CSCwh50989 Headline: Custom COPP causing transit traffic to be punted to the CPU on Nexus 9300-GX2 Symptoms: When custom-COPP policy contains ACL rules which match on Layer 4 destination or source port, transit traffic also hits the COPP and the packets are copied to CPU. This causes duplication of traffic as CPU also routes the copied packets to the destination. Workarounds: Custom COPP policy using src/dst match mitigates punt for transit traffic.

Bug ID Description CSCwa86549 Headline: Nexus 9000 M1100 sees I/O error, goes read-only then leaf crashes Symptoms: Dmesg reports I/O errors followed by remounting the filesystem as read-only:<3>[xxx] Buffer I/O error on device sda4, logical block 0   <4>[xxx] lost page write due to I/O error on sda4   <2>[xxx] EXT4-fs error (device sda4): ext4_journal_check_start:56: Detected aborted journal   <2>[xxx] EXT4-fs (sda4): Remounting filesystem read-only   <3>[xxx] EXT4-fs (sda4): previous I/O error to superblock detected   <6>[xxx] sd 1:0:0:0: [sda] Unhandled error code   <6>[xxx] sd 1:0:0:0: [sda]   <6>[xxx] Result: hostbyte=DID_BAD_TARGET driverbyte=DRIVER_OK  The switch can then proceed to crash due to going read-only Workarounds: Reloading the switch should bring it back to full operation CSCwd53591 Headline: Silent Reload due to watchdog timeout Symptoms: Silent Reload due to watchdog timeout Workarounds: No valid workaround so far CSCwf10364 Headline: kmalloc fail due to SSD writes causing memory frag/higher order page depletion Symptoms: Kmalloc failures due to excessive fragmentation Workarounds: Observe from buddyinfo:cat /proc/buddyinforun bashsync && echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_cachesecho 1 > /proc/sys/vm/compact_memoryIf the above doesn't work then reload box CSCwf40750 Headline: N9K C9336C-FX2 9.3(8) crashed while adding port channel to physical port Symptoms: Unexpected reload happened when adding port channel to physical port.Tahusd core file decode mentions functions related to adding a member to a port channel.The decode is not matching any from our known bugs. Workarounds: No workarounds known CSCwf48692 Headline: N9300-FX3S/FX3 may randomly timeout syncE peer Symptoms: Random syncE peer timeouts. Workarounds: N/A CSCwf58507 Headline: FEX 2348UPQ brings hosts link too fast after powercycle causing traffic blackholing for around 1min. Symptoms: when FEX 2348TQ power-cycles all hosts using (GLC-T, GLC-T-C,SFP-H10GB-CU3M,SFP-H10GB-CU3M) SFPs will have link up while the FEX is down. after ~5 seconds links go up for around 1 minute, despite the fact that FEX from N9k perspective and its FIs are down. Workarounds: Use LACP or any other SFP or upgrade the version. CSCwf82223 Headline: On N9K switch SNMP polling unable to retrieve QSFP DOM values. Symptoms: A third patry DOM supported QSFP will not provide any DOM information when polled via SNMP. Workarounds: Physically reset QSFP28. OIR. CSCwf93175 Headline: FIB and RIB become inconsistent after EIGRP route switchover Symptoms: When there are two EIGRP processes, if the route switchover occur due to a linkflap, the FIB and RIB become inconsistent.

        "content": "Introduction This document describes the features, issues, and exceptions of Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(12) software for use on Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. Note: The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product. Date Description April 25, 2024 Added CSCwh50989 to Open Issues and CSCwe53655 to Resolved Issues . July 01, 2023 Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(12) became available. New and Enhanced Software Features There are no new or enhanced software and hardware features introduced in Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(12). Open Issues Click the bug ID to access the Bug Search tool and see additional information about the bug. Bug ID Description CSCwb63840 Headline: Using NXAPI to poll show processes cpu sometimes returns Invalid CLI output error. Symptoms: Using NXAPI to poll show processes cpu sometimes returns the following error: {'jsonrpc': '2.0', 'error': {'code': -32001, 'message': 'Invalid CLI output', 'data': {'msg': 'CLI output cannot be parsed by the server'}}, 'id': 3} Workarounds: This is a random issue. Hence, poll again until you succeed. CSCwd68210 Headline: Cisco Nexus 9000 and Cisco Nexus 3000 Switch 100Gig Interface does not come up after upgrade of Cisco Nexus 9000. Symptoms: Interface does not come up after the upgrade of Cisco Nexus 9500 from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(4) to 9.3(8). The SFP used is QSFP-100G-CWDM4-S. Link between Cisco Nexus 9000 is N9K-X9736C-FX and leaf is N3K-C36180YC-R. Workarounds: None. CSCwe00551 Headline: Multicast first packet failed to create (S,G) entry on LHR. Symptoms: The following symptoms are seen: ● Receiver comes online before sender sends packet ● (*,G) entry is created on RP, LHR, and Intermediate routers ● Sender first Multicast packet gets punted to CPU on FHR ● (S,G) entry is created on RP ● First packet does not reach the LHR and receiver ● Second multicast packet reaches the LHR and then the (S,G) entry is created on LHR ● No change noticed in spite of configuring ip routing multicast software-replicate on FHR Workarounds: None. CSCwe01333 Headline: Object number in the Track list turns to 0 after upgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.2(3) to 10.2(4). Symptoms: Upgrade the N9K-C93180YC-FX device from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.2(3) to 10.2(4) (disruptive upgrade). Post upgrade, the object value changes from original to 0 not. Workarounds: Re-deploy the missing part of the configuration. CSCwe08 697 Headline: 40G Links flap during ISSU from 9.3(10) to 9.3(11) on N9K-X9464PX. Symptoms: Failure of In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) when upgrading from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(10) to Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(11) with FEX connection on N9K-X9564PX LC 40G interface. Workarounds: None. CSCwf21483 Headline: Block the evpn multisite dci-tracking and evpn multisite fabric-tracking commands on BGW SVI. Symptoms: The evpn multisite dci-tracking and the evpn multisite fabric-tracking commands are placed on the SVI interface. The only supported uplinks in VXLAN are on physical interface, and this command should only exist on uplink ports. Fabric tracking should be on uplink ports in the site-internal network and the dci-tracking commands should be on the uplink ports between sites (site external). The ability to add this command to an SVI even when the ports may be disconnected or admin down, can lead the switch to presume that the ports are back to the site internal or site external or are active and working. The Border-Gateway's isolation mechanism functions by recognizing when the tracking ports are down and by bringing down the loopback for the NVE. With this behavior the NVE remains up. Workarounds: Do not configure BGW SVIs with DCI-tracking or fabric tracking configuration. CSCwf36232 Headline: On Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches, SUP rebooted due to 'licmgr hap reset' when installing license on EoR switches. Symptoms: Switch gets rebooted because of licmgr hap reset. Reason: Reset triggered due to HA policy of Reset Service: licmgr hap reset 2023 Apr 27 09:06:11 %SYSMGR-3-HEARTBEAT_FAILURE: Service \"licmgr\" sent SIGABRT for not setting heartbeat for last 6 periods. Last heartbeat 390.71 secs ago. 2023 Apr 27 09:06:12 %SYSMGR-2-SERVICE_CRASHED: Service \"licmgr\" (PID 28257) hasn't caught signal 6 (core will be saved). Workarounds: None. CSCwf37269 Headline: Nexus 9000 Cloud Scale switches with mix of static and dynamic queue-limit drops low-rate traffic. Symptoms: The symptoms are as follows: 1. Egress interface reports incrementing output discards despite a low rate of traffic destined for that interface. 2. Incrementing occupancy drops under PG-Drop pool  (slot X show hardware internal tah buffer counter). 3. The queue depth remains at 0 byte for the affected Egress interface (show queuing interface), which means that there is no actual congestion for that interface. 4. When sufficiently reducing the static queue-limit configuration or the number of ports configured with static queue-limit, under the same traffic conditions, output discards for the affected interface stop. Workarounds: Use dynamic queue-limits. CSCwf37901 Headline: VXLAN VLANs suspended by vPC consistency checker due to different replication mode and VNI type. Symptoms: VXLAN VLANs are suspended due to different replication mode, but configuration shows that the replication mode is the same on both vPC switches. Workarounds: Reload device shows the difference between replication status and configured replication. CSCwf42887 Headline: On Cisco Nexus 9300-FX3 switches, VXLAN storm-control policer fabric bandwidth does not update after fabric link flap. Symptoms: On Cisco Nexus 9300-FX3 switches, VXLAN storm-control policer fabric bandwidth does not update after fabric link flap. Workarounds: Disable evpn storm-control. Note that shut/no-shut multi-site loopback resets the policer but does not stop the behavior. CSCwf47425 Headline: Ports of N9K-C93600CD-GX with QSA (10G) do not forward traffic. Symptoms: 10G port with QSA adapter is in up state but does not forward traffic. Workarounds: None CSCwf50018 Headline: Fibre Channel snmp trap configuration causes CLI to hang. Symptoms: CLI hangs after entering some snmp traps related to Fibre Channel. If command is aborted with Ctrl + C, the Failed to collect returned stimulus message is seen. Then, other configuration changes, not necessarily related to FC, also experience the same issue. Workarounds: Reloading the switch clears the issue; however, if snmp command is re-entered, the issue repeats. CSCwf50508 Headline: Interfaces sometimes fail to acquire DHCP address if the same address is assigned after the upgrade. Symptoms: Interface that is configured to use DHCP fails to acquire an address if it is assigned the same IP address after the upgrade. When the DHCP client receives an IP address to use from a DHCP server, it applies the IP address through the CLI in the backend. However, the commands are not applied to the interface. When in this state, even a static application of the IP address fails to be programmed onto the interface. Workarounds: Shut down the interface and bring it up again or run the no ip address dhcp command so the interface acquires a DHCP address. CSCwf53532 Headline: Power fluctuates after fan is removed from a Cisco Nexus 9000 series GX switch. Symptoms: When a fan is removed from a Cisco Nexus 9000 GX switch, the power fluctuates in the PSU. Workarounds: None. CSCwf58507 Headline: FEX 2348UPQ brings hosts link too fast after power-cycle causing traffic blackholing for around 1min. Symptoms: When FEX 2348TQ power-cycles all hosts using (GLC-T, GLC-T-C,SFP-H10GB-CU3M,SFP-H10GB-CU3M) SFPs will have link up while the FEX is down. After 5 seconds, links go up for around 1 minute, despite the fact that FEX from Cisco Nexus 9000 perspective and its FIs are down. Workarounds: Use LACP or any other SFP or upgrade the version. CSCwh50989 Headline: Custom COPP causing transit traffic to be punted to the CPU on Nexus 9300-GX2 Symptoms: When custom-COPP policy contains ACL rules which match on Layer 4 destination or source port, transit traffic also hits the COPP and the packets are copied to CPU. This causes duplication of traffic as CPU also routes the copied packets to the destination. Workarounds: Custom COPP policy using src/dst match mitigates punt for transit traffic. Resolved Issues Click the bug ID to access the Bug Search tool and see additional information about the bug. Bug ID Description CSCvg06451 Headline: Remove CLI to configure Fill Pattern as only IDLE is supported. Symptoms: The switchport fill-pattern is not a supported configuration on Cisco Nexus 9000 switches, as only IDLE patterns are supported. Hence, configuration CLI is removed. Workarounds: None. CSCvk54147 Headline: LC module goes to failure state while collecting show tech binary after ISSU. Symptoms: While collecting show tech binary, one or more LC modules in the system may reset due to a fln_que crash. A core file can be seen in show cores and an exceptionlog can be seen in show module internal exceptionlog. Workarounds: Avoid running show-tech binary and use regular show tech if possible. CSCvx24733 Headline: snmp-server enable traps ospf 1 is removed from show run ospf after reloading the device. Symptoms: After the reload, the snmp-server enable traps ospf command does not show up in the output of the show run ospf command but is present in the show running-config command. Additionally, the command cannot be removed from the running-configuration. Workarounds: Write erase and rel...",

When attempting to save the configuration, the log shows configuration copy aborted or configuration copy failed. Workarounds: Bring up the VRF before adding configuration. CSCvx84922 Headline: Interim ACL rule programmed during non-atomic update does not function as expected. Symptoms: During the brief time interval required for the device to update an ACL, an issue with non-atomic updates of Access Control Lists (ACLs) on Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches may result in traffic being permitted instead of being denied. Workarounds: None. This issue only affects the brief time interval required for the non-atomic update of the ACL and the expected ACL behavior is enforced after that. CSCvy75335 Headline: The vmtracker process crash and box potentially reloads with vmtracker configs. Symptoms: When the vmtracker configurations are added on a Cisco Nexus 9000 switch, the vmtracker process may crash and potentially reload the entire switch. Workarounds: Remove the vmtracker configurations if they are not in use. Otherwise, upgrade to a release with the code fix. CSCvz43168 Headline: N9K-C9336-FX2 - 10.1(2) and 9.3(8) - Fan speeds drop to as low as 20%. Symptoms: When N9K-C9336-FX2 runs on 9.3(8) or 10.1(2) code, temperature alarms occur and the difference in speed is observed in the output of the show environment fan detail command. Workarounds: Perform any one of the following workarounds: ● Downgrade to older releases such as 10.1(1) or 9.3(7a) ● Run a script connecting every hour to the affected switch executing the following command: no hardware fan-zone 1 raise-speed 80hardware fan-zone 1 raise-speed 80 CSCvz67451 Headline: Bootflash lifetime usage threshold syslog shows incorrect usage value in the show command. Symptoms: The following syslog appears when the switch reaches a lifetime usage value of 95% on the bootflash. PLATFORM-2-BOOTFLASH_LIFETIME_MAJOR: Bootflash lifetime usage crossed 95%. Collect the output of the show hardware internal bootflash log command and consult the product support team. When the recommended command is checked the output has inaccurate usage percentages. These percentages make it difficult to determine whether the syslog is correct and whether the switch has an issue. Workarounds: None. CSCvz89475 Headline: Cisco Nexus 9300-FX2/FX3 sends untranslated packets using twice NAT when one HW entry is already installed. Symptoms: With twice NAT configuration with pool and overload, packets with untranslated destination address (pool address as destination) are seen in the out-to-in direction. Workarounds: Configure ip nat translation creation-delay 0 in this situation and minimize the time window for which untranslated packets are received. However, the problem may persist. CSCvz01927 Headline: ARP process crash. Symptoms: ARP process crash is seen when the show ip arp vrf XXX commands are executed frequently. Workarounds: To reduce the crash risk, do not run the show ip arp vrf XXX commands too often while ARP entries add/deletes are in progress in the scaled environment. CSCwa05191 Headline: Interface track configured under sub-interface does not work after reload. Symptoms: Interface track is configured under sub-interface. When switch comes back from reload, interface track does not work. For example, an interface track is configured under sub-interface where HSRP is also configured, and the tracked interface is up.

For more information see, Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS System Management Configuration Guide, Release 9.3(x) . Open Issues Bug ID Description CSCvz89475 Headline: N9300 sends NAT untranslated packets when one HW entry is already installed. Symptoms: With NAT pool configuration with overload and twice NAT configured, packets with untranslated address is seen in out to in direction. Workarounds: Configuring \"ip nat translation creation-delay 0\"  can help by minimizing the time window for which untranslated packets are received. The problem can still be seen and hence not a complete workaround. CSCwc11353 Headline: The \"hardware profile multicast optimization disable\" command is not persistent across reload. Symptoms: The \"hardware profile multicast optimization disable\" command is not persistent across reload. Workarounds: After switch reload: 1) Remove the command - no hardware profile multicast optimization disable. 2) Add the command again -  hardware profile multicast optimization disable. 3) Reload all linecards. CSCwc83676 Headline: tahusd process crash may be seen with IPv6 scale deployments on Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(10). Symptoms: For Nexus 9300 and 9500 platform switches running Cisco NX-OS 9.3(10) codes with IPv6 route scale (32K and above) deployments, the show tech-support command output can result in a process crash, and the device reloads. Workarounds: To resolve this issue, use the reload SMU. CSCwe53655 Headline: Revert reserved MAC blocking behavior for VRRP macs on SVIs Symptoms: User is not able to configure VRRP VMAC on SVI interfaces. Workarounds: None. CSCwh50989 Headline: Custom COPP causing transit traffic to be punted to the CPU on Nexus 9300-GX2 Symptoms: When custom-COPP policy contains ACL rules which match on Layer 4 destination or source port, transit traffic also hits the COPP and the packets are copied to CPU. This causes duplication of traffic as CPU also routes the copied packets to the destination. Workarounds: Custom COPP policy using src/dst match mitigates punt for transit traffic. Resolved Issues Bug ID Description CSCwa58073 Headline: 'copy run start' failed after enabling 'feature bfd' due to DME failure Symptoms: Switch had a module inserted and configuration saved before module was removed or offlined, followed by a reload. Later, user tries to enable BFD then execute copy run start. Workarounds: Clear the “DME inconsistency:reload asciior” and clear “nxapi retries”. CSCwa70394 Headline: BFD SMU installation in MM breaks micro-BFD Symptoms: If a switch is booted into maintenance mode with \"system interface shutdown\" in the profile, has SMU CSCvz71312 installed, and then exits maintenance mode - micro-bfd sessions stay in \"session wait\" indefinitely and never come up. This bug can also be reproduced if a switch is reloaded with its micro-BFD-enabled port disabled, has the SMU installed, and then the port enabled. Workarounds: To recover an affected port-channel:no port-channel bfd track-member-linkport-channel bfd track-member-link. The problem can be prevented by rebooting the switch after SMU installation. CSCwa93243 Headline: N9K NAT crash when updating a L2 adjacent link Symptoms: We have a Nexus 9k switch that crashes on the NAT process, generating NAT core files. Workarounds: No workarounds are present at the moment. CSCwb46172 Headline: N3K/N7K/N9K ARP statistics do not increment counter for ip proxy-arp and received arp requests. Symptoms: With 'ip proxy-arp enabled', \"show ip arp statistics\" do not reflect proxy-arp counter when proxy-arp occurs.Also observe the ARP received counters do not increment irrespective of any ip proxy arp configuration or proxy arp requests. Example:N7k-1# show ip arp statistics vlan 10snipReceived: Total 0 <<<<<<< Proxy arp 0 <<<<<<<snip Workarounds: Cosmetic counter issue, no workaround. CSCwb60501 Headline: Nexus routing unicast packets destined to broadcast link layer address Symptoms: A Nexus switch receiving unicast packets destined for broadcast link layer address (ffff:ffff:ffff) routes packet to next hop instead of dropping on CloudScale management interface Workarounds: None. CSCwa79808 Headline: Multiplier set to zero for TWAMP-TEST UDP packets Symptoms: NXOS running platforms set multiplier value at 0 on replying back while running as TWAMP server Workarounds: if the TWAMP client can ignore the Multiplier of zero. CSCwa89845 Headline: Fretta-EOR: SC crash causes EPC/EOBC loss Symptoms: After a system controller crash, in rare cases a linecard may also crash, and there may be packet drops for control plane protocols afterwards. Workarounds: The EMON enhancements are added to 9.3.8 and higher releases could prevent this issue from happening. CSCwa64058 Headline: %NTP-6-NTP_SYSLOG_WARN: : Failed to  send MTS message to destination every 90 secs Symptoms: Following syslog message is seen every 90 seconds%NTP-6-NTP_SYSLOG_WARN: : Failed to send MTS message to destination (node = 0xfe000000, sap = 619), Opcode = MTS_OPC_CLOCK_CHANGE_NOTIF, errno = 32 Workarounds: Configure \"logging level ntp 5\" then above syslog message is masked(default is \"logging level ntp 2\").However almost syslog messages from ntp component are masked. There is no functional impact due to this log if there is no FEX module. CSCuq79793 Headline: IPv6 ND processes NA with Link-layer address 0000.0000.0000 as valid Symptoms: IPv6 ND will install a neighbor entry for an IPv6 host that sends a NA who's Link-layer address field is populated with mac address 0000.0000.0000.

February 8, 2022 Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(9) became available. New and Enhanced Software Features There are no new software and hardware features introduced in Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(9). Open Issues Bug ID Description CSCwa54414 Headline: Static MACs conf on int NVE deleted from vPC secondary after int NVE shut/no shut on vPC primary Symptoms: Static MACs configured on interface NVE may be deleted from vPC secondary device after interface NVE shutdown /no shutdown was executed on vPC primary. Workarounds: Delete/re-create the VLAN/VNI where the static MAC was originally configured and add back the static MAC on interface NVE. no vlan vlan vn-segment mac address-table static  vni  interface nve 1 peer-ip CSCwa52532 Headline: Config Replace fails due to ‘switchport mode’ not supported on L3 interface Symptoms: When you perform Config Replace on a switch with switchport configuration present under an interface, CR might fail due to switchport not supported on a L3 interface: `interface Ethernet1/1` `switchport mode trunk` ERROR: Command validation failed. ERROR: eth1/1: 'switchport mode' is not supported on L3 interface The system default for all interfaces is to operate in L3 mode. Without ‘switchport’ issued initially to convert from L3 to L2 mode, ‘switchport mode’ will fail due to this. Workarounds: 1) Edit the configuration file to include ‘switchport’ before ‘switchport mode’ under the interface configuration prior to performing Config Replace. 2) Configure ‘system default switchport’ in global configuration causing the interfaces to operate in L2 mode by default. CSCvy39573 Headline: Config replace fails with route-map config Symptoms: Config replace for match interface configurations under route-map is not successful. Workarounds: The order of the match interface should be the same. CSCwe53655 Headline: Revert reserved MAC blocking behavior for VRRP macs on SVIs Symptoms: User is not able to configure VRRP VMAC on SVI interfaces. Workarounds: None. CSCwh50989 Headline: Custom COPP causing transit traffic to be punted to the CPU on Nexus 9300-GX2 Symptoms: When custom-COPP policy contains ACL rules which match on Layer 4 destination or source port, transit traffic also hits the COPP and the packets are copied to CPU. This causes duplication of traffic as CPU also routes the copied packets to the destination. Workarounds: Custom COPP policy using src/dst match mitigates punt for transit traffic. Resolved Issues Bug ID Description CSCvx88496 Headline: Telemetry source-interface unable to use dual stack Symptoms: When the source-interface is configured with ipv4 and ipv6 addresses at the same time?Only the newly configured address takes effect.

Workarounds: ++Failover/switchover the HSRP roles, will fix the issue. CSCvy90363 Headline: 9500-R :: Feature ptp causes the spine switch to intercept unicast ARP replies in VxLAN fabric Symptoms: The L2 adjacent host are not able to resolve each others ARP accross VxLan fabric.The broadcasted ARP reply is flooded correctly and reaches all hosts, however the unicast ARP reply is lost inside of the fabric.In fact the ARP replies are redirected to SPINE CPU instead of being forwarded.Other unicast communication works fine (eg. when we configure static ARPs) Workarounds: So far three possible workarounds were identified0. Disable 'featue nv overlay' on Spine. This will avoid this problem and also will ensure better hashing of packets over ECMP links.1. Enable \"arp suppression\"or.2. Remove \"feature ptp\" from the SPINES. After doing so \"reload\" or \"reload ascii\" is required to restore connectivity CSCwa09450 Headline: SNMP memory allocation failure leads to a crash Symptoms: We see high values of RLIMIT and Total for the SNMP process, which leads to a crash Workarounds: There are no workarounds at the moment.The issue is being investigated.

Workarounds: None CSCvx60758 Headline: Bringing up SPAN session silently fails when sFlow data sources are configured. Symptoms: A Nexus 9000 series switch configured with sFlow data sources is not able to administratively bring SPAN sessions online. This is the expected behaviour. However, no error message or feedback to the user is presented if one attempts to bring a SPAN session up while an sFlow data source is configured. Workarounds: There is no known workaround for this issue. This defect introduces an error message to the CLI of the switch when one attempts to bring a SPAN session up while sFlow data sources are configured on the switch. CSCvy19448 Headline: SSH connection rejected with FIPS enabled using any SSH key. Symptoms: SSH connections will be rejected if the FIPS feature is enabled on release 9.3(7).

Date Description November 10, 2020 Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(6) became available. May 13, 2021 Added information about 93108TC-FX3P. April 25, 2024 Added CSCwh50989 to Open Issues.  Contents ■New and Enhanced Software Features ■New Hardware Features ■Release Versioning Strategy ■Open Issues ■Resolved Issues ■Known Issues ■Device Hardware ■Cisco Network Insights for Data Center ■Upgrade and Downgrade ■Exceptions ■Related Content ■Legal Information   The enhanced features listed below are existing features introduced in earlier releases but enhanced to support new platforms in Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(6).  New Features Feature Description VXLAN and IP-in-IP Tunneling Added support for the coexistence of these features for Cisco Nexus 9300-FX2 platform switches. Coexistence of these features requires isolating IP-in-IP tunnels and VXLAN within their own VRFs. By isolating the VRFs, both VXLAN and the tunnels operate independently.  For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS VXLAN Configuration Guide, Release 9.3(x). Enhanced Features Feature Description SVI Interfaces for BGP Interface Peering Added support for Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches.  For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Unicast Routing Configuration Guide, Release 9.3(x). PBR over VXLAN Added support for Cisco Nexus 9300-GX platform switches.  For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS VXLAN Configuration Guide, Release 9.3(x). Proportional Multipath for VNF Added support for Cisco Nexus 9500 platform switches with the N9K-C9508-FM-2 fabric module.  For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS VXLAN Configuration Guide, Release 9.3(x). VXLAN EVPN Multi-Site Storm Control Added enhancements to optimize rate granularity and accuracy. Bandwidth is calculated based on the accumulated DCI uplink bandwidth, and only interfaces tagged with DCI tracking are considered. In addition, granularity is enhanced by supporting two digits after the decimal point. These enhancements apply to Cisco Nexus 9300-EX, 9300-FX/FXP/FX2/FX3, and 9300-GX platform switches.  For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS VXLAN Configuration Guide, Release 9.3(x). VXLAN Flood and Learn Added support for Cisco Nexus 9300-GX platform switches.  For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS VXLAN Configuration Guide, Release 9.3(x). VXLAN with IPv6 in the Underlay (VXLANv6) Added support for Cisco Nexus 9300-GX platform switches.  For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS VXLAN Configuration Guide, Release 9.3(x). Proportional Multipath for VNF with Multi-Site Introduced this feature for Cisco Nexus 9364C, 9300-EX, and 9300-FX/FX2/FX3 platform switches and Cisco Nexus 9500 platform switches with the N9K-C9508-FM-E2 fabric module and an -EX or -FX line card. This feature allows traffic to be sent across sites if a local VNF is not available.  For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS VXLAN Configuration Guide, Release 9.3(x). SVI Unnumbered Added support for Cisco Nexus 9300-GX platform switches.  For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Interfaces Configuration Guide, Release 9.3(x). Multicast Network Load Balancing Added Multicast Network Load Balancing support on Cisco Nexus 9300-GX platform switches.  For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Multicast Routing Configuration Guide, Release 9.3(x). Service exclude-bootconfig Support added for theservice exclude-bootconfigcommand to exclude the boot nxos image configuration from show and copy configuration commands.  For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS System Management Configuration Guide, Release 9.3(x). PTPv1 Forwarding Support added for theptp forward-version1command which forwards all PTPv1 packets based on the forwarding rule and prevents these packets from being dropped.  For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS System Management Configuration Guide, Release 9.3(x).  No new hardware features are introduced for Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(6). Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches and the Cisco Nexus 3000 Series switches, use the same NX-OS binary image also called the “unified\" image. The binary image covers all variations of the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches and Cisco Nexus 3000 Series switches. Cisco NX-OS Release 9.2(1) was the first release that adopted unified version numbering. With unified version numbering, the platform designator is obsolete. Moving forward for the previously identified platforms, we will be adopting the simplified 3-letter versioning scheme. For example, a release with X.Y(Z) would mean: X – Unified release major Y – Major / Minor release Z – Maintenance release (MR) Where the Z = 1 is always the first FCS release of a Major/Minor release. An example of a previous release number is: 7.0(3)I7(4). In this format, the ‘I’ is the platform designator. Note: In order to accommodate upgrade compatibility from an older software version that is expecting a platform designator, when theinstall allcommand is entered or theshow install all impactcommand is entered, the version string appears as 9.3(6)I9(1). The “I9(1)” portion of the string can be safely ignored. It will later appear as 9.3(6). Note: The Cisco Nexus 34180YC and 3464C platform switches are not supported in Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(6). Bug ID Description CSCvq33024 Headline: TRM Multisite: traffic drop on BGW after restarting ngmvpn  Symptoms: TRM traffic loss for 1-2 seconds.  Workarounds: None CSCvw38210 Headline: FX2: ipfib crash post ND-ISSU when multicast global-span-tx  Symptoms: On 9300-EX/FX2 switches, ipfib crash is observed post non-disruptive install (ND ISSU) in the presence of the configuration 'hardware multicast global-span-tx’.  Workarounds: Disable by “no hardware multicast global-span-tx”, copy run start or chose disruptive install upgrade. The “hardware multicast global-span-tx” command can be enabled post upgrade. CSCvq15147 Headline: Interface BW not accounting unicast BW after SSO switchover  Symptoms: After a switchover, the unicast fabric bandwidth does not get reserved on fabric links.  Workarounds: Flapping the fabric interface should fix it. CSCvw42172 Headline: grpc core seeing with the command grpc use-vrf default and no feature grpc/feature grpc  Symptoms: The grpc process crashes when trying to unconfigure grpc (“no feature grpc”) when the base grpc config has “grpc use-vrf default” already configured. After this feature grpc cannot be re-enabled.  Workarounds:  1.Go to bash prompt by doing “run bash sudo su\". 2.Kill the grpc process 3 times by doing “kill `pidof grpc”. 3.Check that the process doesn't exist by doing “ps aux | grep grpc”. 4.Come back to CLI from bash shell by running “exit”. 5.The grpc feature can be enabled now if needed. CSCwh50989 Headline: Custom COPP causing transit traffic to be punted to the CPU on Nexus 9300-GX2  Symptoms: When custom-COPP policy contains ACL rules which match on Layer 4 destination or source port, transit traffic also hits the COPP and the packets are copied to CPU. This causes duplication of traffic as CPU also routes the copied packets to the destination.  Workarounds: Custom COPP policy using src/dst match mitigates punt for transit traffic.  Bug ID Description CSCvv04779 Headline: FEX 2248 is dropping multicast during IGMP update from client on a different FEX Symptoms: FEX N2K-C2248TP-E-1GE with a Nexus 5000 parent switch is intermittently dropping a small number of multicast packets during IGMP updates coming to the parent switch. Workarounds: Replace the FEX with a switch. CSCvo04435 Headline: FEX port running FCoE goes into ErrDisabled (Pause Frame) without RX pause framesSymptoms: FCoE Ethernet ports are repeatedly going into error disabled state with the reason of excessive Rx pause frames.

Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Release Notes, Release 9.3(4) This document describes the features, issues, and exceptions of Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(4) software for use on Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. For more information, seeRelated Content. Date Description April 25, 2024 Added CSCwh50989 toOpen Issues. June 30, 2020 Added CSCvu20429 toOpen Issues. May 14, 2020 Added CSCvs50843 toResolved Issues. May 2, 2020 Added CSCvt68363 toResolved Issues. April 29, 2020 Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(4) became available.  Contents ■New Software Features ■New Hardware Features ■Release Versioning Strategy ■Open Issues ■Resolved Issues ■Known Issues ■Device Hardware ■Cisco Network Insights for Data Center ■Upgrade and Downgrade ■Exceptions ■Related Content ■Legal Information   Feature Description IGMP Host Proxy The IGMP host proxy support is provided for underlay multicast on Cisco Nexus 9232C, 9332C and 9364C switches with port-channel (L3) uplink. For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Multicast Routing Configuration Guide, Release 9.3(x). Feature Description N2200-PDC-350W-B The Cisco Nexus 92348GC-X NX-OS Mode Switch (N9K-C92348GC-X) now supports the 350-W DC power supply with port-side intake airflow (N2200-PDC-350W-B). For more information, see theCisco Nexus 92348GC-X NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide. N2200-PDC-400W The Cisco Nexus 92348GC-X NX-OS Mode Switch (N9K-C92348GC-X) now supports the 400-W DC power supply with port-side exhaust airflow (N2200-PDC-400W). For more information, see theCisco Nexus 92348GC-X NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide. Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches and the Cisco Nexus 3000 Series switches, use same NX-OS binary image also called the “unified\" image. The binary image covers the Cisco Nexus 9300 and 9500 and Cisco Nexus 3100, 3200, 3400-S, 3500, and 3600 platform switches. Cisco NX-OS Release 9.2(1) was the first release that adopted unified version numbering. With unified version numbering, the platform designator is obsolete. Moving forward for the previously identified platforms, we will be adopting the simplified 3-letter versioning scheme. For example, a release with X.Y(Z) would mean: X – Unified release major Y – Major / Minor release Z – Maintenance release (MR) Where the Z = 1 is always the first FCS release of a Major/Minor release. An example of a previous release number is: 7.0(3)I7(4). In this format, the ‘I’ is the platform designator. Note: In order to accommodate upgrade compatibility from an older software version that is expecting a platform designator, when theinstall allcommand is entered or theshow install all impactcommand is entered, the version string appears as 9.3(4)I9(1). The “I9(1)” portion of the string can be safely ignored. It will later appear as 9.3(4). Note: The Cisco Nexus 34180YC and 3464C platform switches are not supported in Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(4). Bug ID Description CSCvj63603 Headline: OC ACL: delete ipv4 ace with hop-limit configs fails Symptoms: When we have an ACE with hop-limit configs that were configured through the CLI and you try to delete it through NETCONF, it returns 'List delete failed' error, instead of deleting that entry from the configs. Workarounds: Create ACE through netconf (or) Delete ACE through CLI CSCvm11554 Headline: PTP High correction on slave when master have SVI which have IGMP Connected Group Membership Symptoms: When SVI on a PTP master switch receives an IGMP membership report and creates IGMP entries, PTP High correction issues occur. %PTP-2-PTP_HIGH_CORR: Slave port Eth1/X High correction -125750482(nsec) This issue is applicable only to Cisco Nexus 9500-R platforms. Workarounds: A or B A. - Remove PIM config from PTP VLAN SVI B. - Use other VLAN to PTP instead of VLAN used for multicast CSCvn07656 Headline: ACL Stats - Packet hitting an ACE entry with log option will be counted twice Symptoms: With ACL logging enabled on the ingress ACL, each packet hit is counted twice in TCAM stats. Once for the original packet and once for the SUP copy. Workarounds: None CSCvp02447 Headline: Snmpbulkwalk/getnext periodic slowness seen in PFC-EXT-mibs. Symptoms: None Workarounds: None CSCvp20546 Headline: Multiste EVPN Scale-after multiple flaps of NVE mac address is out of sync between BGP and L2RIB Symptoms: MAC table is pointing to incorrect NH after multiple NVE flaps Workarounds: Clear ip arp force-delete or clear ipv6 nd force-delete (if v6 host) and clear MAC address table CSCvp75031 Headline: Nexus 9300 - Block CLI to configure sub-interface with 40G uplink ports Symptoms: Sub-interfaces are not supported for 40G uplinks ports with 1st generation Cisco Nexus 9300 platform switches. BUM (broadcast, multicast, unknown unicast) traffic might not egress local ports after VXLAN decapsulation of such traffic. Not all traffic is impacted depending on internal load-balancing of traffic between internal ASICs. Workarounds: Do not use sub-interfaces for 40G uplinks ports. You can have sub-interfaces on 10G downstream ports. CSCvq15147 Headline: Interface BW not accounting unicast BW after SSO switchover Symptoms: After a switchover, the unicast fabric bandwidth does not get reserved on fabric links. Workarounds: Flapping the fabric interface should fix it. CSCvq33024 Headline: TRM Multisite: traffic drop on BGW after restarting ngmvpn Symptoms: TRM traffic loss for 1-2 seconds. Workarounds: None CSCvq44103 Headline: 25g AOC/LR/SR Cable type is shown as unknown Symptoms: Cable type is shown as \"unknown\" for 25G SFP- LR, SR, and AOC cables. However, for copper 25G cables 'cable type' is displayed as CA-L, CA-N and CA-S accordingly. Workarounds: There is no workaround for this problem. CSCvr75903 Headline: Sequence timeout seen at reload with VXLAN PBR -- SVI flap optimizations needed. Symptoms: The system might experience a sequence timeout that might cause the L2alredirect loopback test to fail, rpm verification to fail, or a DHCP snoop hardware programming failure. When hit on the vPC secondary, this situation might result in vPC VLANs getting suspended on primary. Workarounds: Once the issue is hit, you can shut/no-shut the MCT link in vPC primary or operational primary to bring up the suspended VLANS. Also, to avoid getting into this situation, you may use GIR (graceful insertion and removal) to isolate the 9500, upgrade the chassis, and after all modules are up, insert the switch in to the network. CSCvr76803 Headline: Netstack core seen in non-destructive ISSU using FQDN for NTP Symptoms: FQDN for NTP server and ND ISSU on T2 ToR Workarounds: Do not use FQDN for NTP Servers. Use IP Address. CSCvs15713 Headline: FC 48 ports entitlement tag is consumed even with 16 or less ports are configured Symptoms: FC 48 ports entitlement tag is consumed irrespective of the number of FC ports acquired. Workarounds: None.  This will not impact the functionality of ports. CSCvs28295 Headline: MPLS entries present after no feature-set mpls command Symptoms: After entering the \"no feature-set mpls\" command, the output of the \"show for adjacency mpls stats\" command is not empty. Workarounds: Reload the box. CSCvs41360 Headline: N9K-C93600CD-GX: Extra Flaps seen after Multiple reloads/flaps on different Optics on Gearbox Ports Symptoms: One Extra Flap seen after Multiple reloads/flaps on different Optics on ports 1-24 of N9K-C93600CD-GX. Similar extra flap seen after Multiple reloads/flaps on QSFP-100G-PSM4 and QSFP-100G-FR of N9K-9364C-GX. Workarounds: None CSCvs49263 Headline: Traffic outage when switching 4x25G --> 2x50G --> 4x25G soft-breakout, control plane is fine Symptoms: PIXMC-SDB would be wrong Breakout third port LTL will be assigned 2nd port ifidx Workarounds: Reload module. CSCvs50407 Headline: Multicast traffic drop due to NF flag set. Symptoms: On T2-EoR that is part of a vPC pair, ND-ISSU (modular) is done from 7.0.(3)I4(0) to 9.3(3) and there is a loss of multicast traffic towards receivers on L3 interfaces. That is, non vPC-SVI OIF. Workarounds: Use an intermediate ISSU from 7.0(3)I4(0) to 9.3(2) on both vPC peers, and then an ISSU from 9.3(2) to 9.3(3). CSCvt06466 Headline: N9K-C9364C-GX: 100G CRC (1/50,53, AOC 1M/5M) after 61st/16th reload Symptoms: During reload loop we observed that one of the lanes on a couple of ports on a particular board (port 53) that one of the lanes of the port shows low SNR compared to other lanes of that same port. Due to this low SNR, CRC is seen on that lane. Issue is seen only with one board and only when AOC cable is connected. Workarounds: Flap the port to recover. CSCvt18150 Headline: BootupPortLoopback is not running consistently for 4x10G Breakout on Native 400G Ports Symptoms: The Gold bootup port loopback test remains untested if the port is in 4x10 breakout mode. Workarounds: To get the bootup test working on a port, un-breakout the port and reload the card. CSCvt28463 Headline: N9K-93XX-GX: Delayed link up between Gearbox Ports to bear valley on Peer for 40G AOC ports Symptoms: 40G AOC connection from N9K-C9364C-GX to N9K-C9364C (port 49 to 64) or N9K-C9336C-FX2 (port 1 to 6, 33 to 36) might see a longer link up time. Workarounds: Use port 1 to 48 on N9K-C9364C or port 7 to 32 on N9K-C9336C-FX2, or use other 40G optics than AOC. CSCvt43179 Headline: IPv6 BGP neighborship fails to come up (Idle state) on N9K-C93180YC-FX Symptoms: Below syslogs ar...",

The binary image covers the Cisco Nexus 9300 and 9500 and Cisco Nexus 3100, 3200, 3400-S, 3500, and 3600 platform switches. Cisco NX-OS Release 9.2(1) was the first release that adopted unified version numbering. With unified version numbering, the platform designator is obsolete. Moving forward for the previously identified platforms, we will be adopting the simplified 3-letter versioning scheme. For example, a release with X.Y(Z) would mean: X – Unified release major Y – Major / Minor release Z – Maintenance release (MR) Where the Z = 1 is always the first FCS release of a Major/Minor release. An example of a previous release number is: 7.0(3)I7(4). In this format, the ‘I’ is the platform designator. Note: In order to accommodate upgrade compatibility from an older software version that is expecting a platform designator, when theinstall allcommand is entered or theshow install all impactcommand is entered, the version string appears as 9.3(1)I9(1). The “I9(1)” portion of the string can be safely ignored. It will later appear as 9.3(1). When you downgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(1) to an earlier release, the features that use the ACI+NX-OS Essentials, Advantage, and add-on licenses or the Hardware Streaming Telemetry license continue to work in honor mode in the downgraded version. In addition, the output of theshow license usagecommand continues to include entries for these unsupported licenses. For more information, see theCisco NX-OS Licensing Guide. ■Supported Device Hardware ■Supported Optics ■Supported FEX Modules The following tables list the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series hardware that Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(1) supports.

The Cisco NX-OS software provides a robust and comprehensive feature set that meets the requirements of virtualization and automation in mission-critical data center environments. The modular design of the Cisco NX-OS operating system makes zero-impact operations a reality and enables exceptional operational flexibility. The Cisco Nexus 3000 Series switches, which includes Cisco Nexus 3100, 3200, 3400-S, 3500, and 3600 platform switches, and Cisco Nexus 9300 and 9500 platform switches run on the same binary image, also called the “unified” image. Cisco NX-OS Release 9.2(1) is the first release that adopts unified version numbering. As more platforms have been added, there is no need to have a “platform” designator as used in the past. An example of a previous release number is: 7.0(3)I7(4). In this format, the ‘I’ is the platform designator. Moving forward for the previously identified platforms, we will be adopting the simplified 3-letter versioning scheme. For example, a release with X.Y(Z) would mean: X – Unified release major Y – Major / Minor release Z – Maintenance release (MR) Where the Z = 1 is always the first FCS release of a Major/Minor release. Note: In order to accommodate upgrade compatibility from an older software version that is expecting a platform designator, when theinstall allcommand is entered or theshow install all impactcommand is entered, the version string appears as 9.2(1)I9(1). The “I9(1)” portion of the string can be safely ignored. It will later appear as 9.2(1). Temporary licenses with an expiry date are available for evaluation and lab use purposes. They are strictly not allowed to be used in production. Please use a permanent or subscription license that has been purchased through Cisco for production purposes. When you downgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.2(4) to an earlier release, the features that use the ACI+NX-OS Essentials, Advantage, and add-on licenses or the Hardware Streaming Telemetry license continue to work in honor mode in the downgraded version. In addition, the output of thehow license usagecommand continues to include entries for these unsupported licenses. For more information, see theCisco NX-OS Licensing Guide. This section includes the following sections: ■Supported Device Hardware ■Supported Optics ■Supported FEX Modules The following tables list the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series hardware that Cisco NX-OS Release 9.2(4) supports.

The Cisco NX-OS software provides a robust and comprehensive feature set that meets the requirements of virtualization and automation in mission-critical data center environments. The modular design of the Cisco NX-OS operating system makes zero-impact operations a reality and enables exceptional operational flexibility. The Cisco Nexus 3000 Series switches, which includes Cisco Nexus 3100, 3200, 3400-S, 3500, and 3600 platform switches, and Cisco Nexus 9300 and 9500 platform switches run on the same binary image, also called the “unified” image. Cisco NX-OS Release 9.2(1) is the first release that adopts unified version numbering. As more platforms have been added, there is no need to have a “platform” designator as used in the past. An example of a previous release number is: 7.0(3)I7(4). In this format, the ‘I’ is the platform designator. Moving forward for the previously identified platforms, we will be adopting the simplified 3-letter versioning scheme. For example, a release with X.Y(Z) would mean: X – Unified release major Y – Major / Minor release Z – Maintenance release (MR) Where the Z = 1 is always the first FCS release of a Major/Minor release. Note: In order to accommodate upgrade compatibility from an older software version that is expecting a platform designator, when theinstall allcommand is entered or theshow install all impactcommand is entered, the version string appears as 9.2(1)I9(1). The “I9(1)” portion of the string can be safely ignored. It will later appear as 9.2(1). Temporary licenses with an expiry date are available for evaluation and lab use purposes. They are strictly not allowed to be used in production. Please use a permanent or subscription license that has been purchased through Cisco for production purposes. When you downgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.2(3) to an earlier release, the features that use the ACI+NX-OS Essentials, Advantage, and add-on licenses or the Hardware Streaming Telemetry license continue to work in honor mode in the downgraded version. In addition, the output of thehow license usagecommand continues to include entries for these unsupported licenses. For more information, see theCisco NX-OS Licensing Guide.

CSCvq02430 Headline: Reload timer command fails if user session closesSymptoms: When user sends the reload timer command, and answers yes to the prompt then logs out of the session, the reload timer fails to execute. However, if user remains logged into the device, it reloads as expected.Workarounds: The user has to stay logged into the device to get the command to work. CSCvq62128 Headline: Config change of deleting cast-group and enabling IR under member VNI, fails Symptoms: On NVE1, config change of deleting mcast-group and enabling IR under member VNI, fails. Workarounds: Wait for a while after deleting mcast-group, and then enable IR under member VNI. CSCvq81656 Headline: N9K-C9336C-FX2 front port ingress direction silent drop packetSymptoms: The link connection is up but the port could not receive any traffic. All incoming packets dropped by ingress buffer.Workarounds: None CSCvr00644 Headline: Multi-Site  BGW silently drops DCI BUM traffic if Rx line card has no active OIF fabric-linkSymptoms: Broadcast, unknown unicast and multicast (BUM) traffic are dropped at the border gateway (BGW) in some VLANs as it arrives at a site on the BGW device. This will result in failure of both the data plane and control plane traffic such as ARP and HSRP in one or more VLANs between sites.Workarounds: One of the following will temporarily recover the condition on the BGW: 1. Remove and re-add VLAN.2. Remove and reconfigure (re-add) the VNI under the NVE interface.3. Bounce (shut/no shut) the NVE interface. Note that these workarounds do not prevent the issue from occurring again if any of the triggers are invoked. Issue resolved in Cisco NX-OS 9.3.2 and later. CSCvr47876 Headline: Port-channel ECN marked packets statistics is incorrect on show policy-map int detail Symptoms: Port-channel ECN marked packets statistics is incorrect on show policy-map int detail Workarounds: Use the \"show queuing\" or \"show queuing tabular\" commands to check the  counter. CSCvs12578 Headline: Security: service NTP SIGABRT due to heartbeat failureSymptoms: The Cisco NX-OS NTP process can get busy while processing older version NTP packets and may miss sending heartbeat messages.

The Cisco NX-OS software provides a robust and comprehensive feature set that meets the requirements of virtualization and automation in mission-critical data center environments. The modular design of the Cisco NX-OS operating system makes zero-impact operations a reality and enables exceptional operational flexibility. The Cisco Nexus 3000 Series switches, which includes Cisco Nexus 3100, 3200, 3400-S, 3500, and 3600 platform switches, and Cisco Nexus 9300 and 9500 platform switches run on the same binary image, also called the “unified” image. Cisco NX-OS Release 9.2(1) is the first release that adopts unified version numbering. As more platforms have been added, there is no need to have a “platform” designator as used in the past. An example of a previous release number is: 7.0(3)I7(4). In this format, the ‘I’ is the platform designator. Moving forward for the previously identified platforms, we will be adopting the simplified 3-letter versioning scheme. For example, a release with X.Y(Z) would mean: X – Unified release major Y – Major / Minor release Z – Maintenance release (MR) Where the Z = 1 is always the first FCS release of a Major/Minor release. Note: In order to accommodate upgrade compatibility from an older software version that is expecting a platform designator, when theinstall allcommand is entered or theshow install all impactcommand is entered, the version string appears as 9.2(1)I9(1). The “I9(1)” portion of the string can be safely ignored. It will later appear as 9.2(1). Temporary licenses with an expiry date are available for evaluation and lab use purposes. They are strictly not allowed to be used in production. Please use a permanent or subscription license that has been purchased through Cisco for production purposes. For more information, see theCisco NX-OS Licensing Guide.

The FEXs can be used in Active/Standby and Active/Active modes and in a Host vPC. There are no new software features in Cisco NX-OS Release 6.1(2)I2(3). Only one software image (called nx-os) is required to load the Cisco NX-OS operating system. This image runs on all Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. For installation instructions, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Software Upgrade and Downgrade Guide. To perform a software upgrade, follow the installation instructions in theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Software Upgrade and Downgrade Guide. For information about software maintenance upgrades, see the “Performing Software Maintenance Upgrades” section in theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS System Management Configuration Guide. NoteIf you perform a software maintenance upgrade (SMU) and later upgrade your device to a new Cisco NX-OS software release, the new image will overwrite both the previous Cisco NX-OS release and the SMU package file.  This section lists limitations related to Cisco NX-OS Release 6.1(2)I2(3). –no speed: Autonegotiates and advertises all speeds (only full duplex). –speed 100: Does not autonegotiate; pause cannot be advertised.The peer must be set to not autonegotiate (only 100 Mbps full duplex is supported). –speed 1000: Autonegotiates and advertises pause (advertises only for 1000 Mbps full duplex). NoteTo work around the situation of Unicast NLB limitation, we can statically hard code the ARP and MAC address pointing to the correct interface.

Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)F3(4) supports the following new software features: Interface Features ■Q-in-Q on both access ports and LAGs—Added support to configure custom EtherType field values on a port to support network devices that do not use the standard 0x8100 EtherType field value on 802.1Q-tagged or 802.1p-tagged frames. ■MAC Address Limitation on a VLAN—Added the ability to set an upper limit for the number of MAC addresses that can reside inside the MAC address table of a line card expansion module (LEM). For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Interfaces Configuration Guide, Release 7.x. Security Feature ■ACEs in System ACL—Configuring IPv4 PACLs in the range of 12,000 to 64,000 is now supported on Cisco Nexus 9500 platform switches with -RX line cards. ■Configuring System ACLs—You can configure system ACLs on Cisco Nexus 9500 platform switches with -R and -RX line cards. With system ACLs, you can configure Layer 2 port ACLs (PACLs) on all the ports with the same access-list in the switch. Configuring system ACLs reduces the TCAM usage and also brings down the time and memory usage while the policy is being applied or modified. For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Security Configuration Guide, Release 7.x. VXLAN Feature ■IGMP Snooping—Support added for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch with 9636-RX line cards.

This section lists the following topics: ■New Hardware Features in Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)F3(3) ■New Software Features in Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)F3(3) Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)F3(3) does not include new hardware features. Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)F3(3) supports the following software features for Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. Label Switching Features ■BGP VPNv4 Multipath—BGP VPNv4 Multipath feature to achieve Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) for traffic flowing from an Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR) towards the Provider Edge (PE) device in a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) cloud network by using a lower number of prefixes and MPLS labels. This feature configures the maximum number of multipaths for both eBGP and iBGP paths. This feature can be configured on PE devices and Route Reflectors in an MPLS topology. ■MPLS L3 VPN—MPLS-based Layer 3 VPNs are based on a peer model that enables the provider and the customer to exchange Layer 3 routing information. MPLS Layer 3 VPN consists of a set of sites that are interconnected by an MPLS provider core network. At each customer site, one or more customer edge (CE) routers or Layer 2 switches attach to one or more provider edge (PE) routers.§RFC 3107 Inter AS ■Option-B—The InterAS option B (with RFC 3107) implementation ensures complete IGP isolation between the data centers and WAN. When BGP advertises a particular route to ASBR, it also distributes the label which is mapped to that route. For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Label Switching Configuration Guide, Release 7.x.  Quality of Service Features ■Shared Policer—Allows you to apply the same QoS policing parameters to several interfaces simultaneously. ■Updated commands—show icam resource and show icam prediction resource command with fib_tcam and l2_table parameters. ■VLAN QoS—Enables Layer 2 bridged database lookup for QoS with VLAN as the key instead of the port. For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series Quality of Service Configuration Guide, Release 7.x. System Management Feature ■PTP – Added support for AES67 and SMPTE 2059-2 PTP profiles  For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS System Management Configuration Guide, Release 7.x Unicast Routing Features ■Added the ability to configure an HSRP subnet virtual IP address (VIP) and a different subnet than that of the SVISVI IP address. This feature enables you to conserve public IPv4 addresses by using a VIP as a public IP address and an interface IP as a private IP address. ■Policy-based routing (PBR) – Configures a defined policy for IPv4 and IPv6 traffic flows that lessens the reliance on routes derived from routing protocols. All packets received on an interface with PBR enabled are passed through enhanced packet filters or route maps. The route maps dictate the policy that determines where to forward packets. ■vPC uRPF—Updated Guidelines and Limitations. For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Unicast Routing Configuration Guide, Release 7.x. VXLAN Features ■VXLAN Layer 2 Gateway oARP Suppression—Added support for ARP suppression. oIPv6—Added support for IPv6 in the overlay. oPIM-ASM—Added support for Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) and Any Source Multicast (ASM). oVXLAN and MPLS—Added CLI commands to configure all or individual line cards. For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS VXLAN Configuration Guide, Release 7.x.

Introduction This document describes the Cisco IP fabric for media solution, new hardware, software features, upgrade instructions, and caveats for Cisco NX-OS Release 10.5(1)F software for use on Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches. Table 1. Online History Change: Date Description July 26, 2024 Cisco NX-OS Release 10.5(1)F became available IP Fabric for Media Today, the broadcast industry uses a serial digital interface (SDI) router and SDI cables to transport video and audio traffic. The SDI cables can carry only a single unidirectional signal. As a result, many cables, frequently stretched over long distances, are required, making it difficult and time-consuming to expand or change an SDI-based infrastructure. Cisco’s IP fabric for media solution helps transition from an SDI router to an IP-based infrastructure. In an IP-based infrastructure, a single cable can carry multiple bidirectional traffic flows and can support different flow sizes without requiring changes to the physical infrastructure. The solution uses Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches in conjunction with the Cisco non-blocking multicast (NBM) algorithm (an intelligent traffic management algorithm) and with or without the Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC) IP for Media Fabric (IPFM) to provide a highly reliable (zero drop multicast), highly visible, highly secure, and highly available network. Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media solution supports the following types of deployments: ● Spine-leaf topology—A single or multi-spine deployment method with variable flow size that allows the NBM fabric to form a multicast flow. ● Single modular switch—An architecture suitable for fixed deployments, with the controller providing features such as flow visibility, security, and monitoring. New Hardware Features There are no new hardware features in this release.

Any other features are not supported in Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)F2(1). Interfaces Features ■UniDirectional Link Detection (UDLD)— The Cisco-proprietary Unidirectional Link Detection (UDLD) protocol allows devices that are connected through fiber-optic or copper (for example, Category 5 cabling) Ethernet cables to monitor the physical configuration of the cables and detect when a unidirectional link exists. When a device detects a unidirectional link, UDLD shuts down the affected LAN port and alerts the user. Unidirectional links can cause a variety of problems. For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Interfaces Configuration Guide, Release 7.x IP Fabric for Media Features ■Introduces support for the IP fabric for media solution, which helps transition SDI-based broadcasting networks to an IP-based infrastructure. The solution features the Cisco non-blocking multicast (NBM) algorithm (an intelligent traffic management algorithm) and may use the Cisco DCNM Media Controller. It provides a highly reliable (zero-drop multicast), highly visible, highly secure, and highly available network. The Cisco Nexus 9508 switch with the N9K-X9636C-R and N9K-X9636Q-R line cards supports two deployment methods: oA spine-leaf topology with the DCNM Media Controller—A flexible architecture for large-scale deployments typically seen in an IP studio. oA single modular switch without the DCNM Media Controller—A simple deployment method for environments such as outside broadcasting (OB) vans; for Layer 3 only. For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series IP Fabric for Media Solution Guide, Releases 7.0(3)I4(5), 7.0(3)I6(1), and 7.0(3)F2(1)and theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release Notes, Release 7.0(3)F2(1). Multicast Routing Features ■IGMP Snooping—IGMP snooping software examines Layer 2 IP multicast traffic within a VLAN to discover the ports where interested receivers reside. Using the port information, IGMP snooping can reduce bandwidth consumption in a multi-access LAN environment to avoid flooding the entire VLAN. IGMP snooping tracks which ports are attached to multicast-capable routers to help the routers forward IGMP membership reports. The IGMP snooping software responds to topology change notifications. By default, IGMP snooping is enabled on the device. ■PIM SSM IPv4—Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) builds a source tree originating at the designated router on the LAN segment that receives a request to join a multicast source. SSM mode does not require you to configure RPs. Source discovery must be accomplished through other means. For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Multicast Routing Configuration Guide, Release 7.x. Security Features ■Unicast RPF (uRPF) – Prevents malformed or spoofed source addresses from entering the network by discarding IPv4 or IPv6 packets that lack a verifiable IP source address. For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Security Configuration Guide, Release 7.x.  System Management Features ■sFlow—Sampled flow (sFlow) allows you to monitor real-time traffic in data networks that contain switches and routers. It uses the sampling mechanism in the sFlow agent software on switches and routers to monitor traffic and to forward the sample data to the central data collector. Ingress sFLow is supported. Egress sFlow is not supported. ■SPAN Sources—The interfaces from which traffic can be monitored are called SPAN sources. Sources designate the traffic to monitor and whether to copy ingress, egress, or both directions of traffic. SPAN sources include the following: oEthernet ports (but not subinterfaces) oPort channels oThe inband interface to the control plane CPU For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS System Management Configuration Guide, Release 7.x.  Unicast Routing Features ■EIGRP V4/V6—EIGRP combines the benefits of distance vector protocols with the features of link-state protocols. EIGRP sends out periodic Hello messages for neighbor discovery. Once EIGRP learns a new neighbor, it sends a one-time update of all the local EIGRP routes and route metrics. The receiving EIGRP router calculates the route distance based on the received metrics and the locally assigned cost of the link to that neighbor. After this initial full route table update, EIGRP sends incremental updates to only those neighbors affected by the route change. This process speeds convergence and minimizes the bandwidth used by EIGRP. ■IS-IS—The IS-IS is an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) based on Standardization (ISO)/International Engineering Consortium (IEC) 10589. Cisco NX-OS supports Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and IPv6. IS-IS is a dynamic link-state routing protocol that can detect changes in the network topology and calculate loop-free routes to other nodes in the network. Each router maintains a link-state database that describes the state of the network and sends packets on every configured link to discover neighbors. IS-IS floods the link-state information across the network to each neighbor. The router also sends advertisements and updates on the link-state database through all the existing neighbors. ■RIP v2—RIP uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP) data packets to exchange routing information in small internetworks. RIPv2 supports IPv4. RIPv2 uses an optional authentication feature supported by the RIPv2 protocol. For more information, see theCisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Unicast Routing Configuration Guide, Release 7.x.

Introduction This document describes the Cisco IP fabric for media solution, new hardware, software features, upgrade instructions, and caveats for Cisco NX-OS Release 10.5(2)F software for use on Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches. Table 1. Online History Change: Date Description November 27, 2024 Cisco NX-OS Release 10.5(2)F became available IP Fabric for Media Today, the broadcast industry uses a serial digital interface (SDI) router and SDI cables to transport video and audio traffic. The SDI cables can carry only a single unidirectional signal. As a result, many cables, frequently stretched over long distances, are required, making it difficult and time-consuming to expand or change an SDI-based infrastructure. Cisco’s IP fabric for media solution helps transition from an SDI router to an IP-based infrastructure. In an IP-based infrastructure, a single cable can carry multiple bidirectional traffic flows and can support different flow sizes without requiring changes to the physical infrastructure. The solution uses Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches in conjunction with the Cisco non-blocking multicast (NBM) algorithm (an intelligent traffic management algorithm) and with or without the Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC) IP for Media Fabric (IPFM) to provide a highly reliable (zero drop multicast), highly visible, highly secure, and highly available network. Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media solution supports the following types of deployments: ● Spine-leaf topology—A single or multi-spine deployment method with variable flow size that allows the NBM fabric to form a multicast flow. ● Single modular switch—An architecture suitable for fixed deployments, with the controller providing features such as flow visibility, security, and monitoring.

Priority flow is not supported on PIM passive mode. However, this operation is applicable only when there is lack of bandwidth in the fabric. For more information, see Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Solution Guide, Release 10.5(x). Increased Egress NAT translations per port Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.5(2)F, the range for maximum replications for the map interface is increased to 250. This enhanced range is supported on all the platforms that support multicast NAT. For more information  see, Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Multicast Routing Configuration Guide Release 10.5(x). Open Issues There are no open issues in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 10.5(2)F. Resolved Issues There are no resolved issues in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 10.5(2)F. Upgrade and Downgrade To perform a software upgrade or downgrade, follow the instructions in the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Software Upgrade and Downgrade Guide, Release 10.5(x). For information about an In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU), see the Cisco NX-OS ISSU Support Matrix . Limitations Sub interfaces should be in the same nbm VRF mode as its parent interface. They (parent port and its sub interfaces) can be in either nbm pim-active or nbm pim-passive mode. For example: If the parent port is part of NBM VRF which is in PIM active mode, its subinterfaces must also be in the VRF (can be different VRF context) with the same PIM active mode.

        "content": "Introduction This document describes the Cisco IP fabric for media solution, new hardware, software features, upgrade instructions, and caveats for Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(2)F software for use on Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches. Note: The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product. Table 1. Online History Change: Date Description December 14, 2023 Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(2)F became available IP Fabric for Media Today, the broadcast industry uses a serial digital interface (SDI) router and SDI cables to transport video and audio traffic. The SDI cables can carry only a single unidirectional signal. As a result, many cables, frequently stretched over long distances, are required, making it difficult and time-consuming to expand or change an SDI-based infrastructure. Cisco’s IP fabric for media solution helps transition from an SDI router to an IP-based infrastructure. In an IP-based infrastructure, a single cable can carry multiple bidirectional traffic flows and can support different flow sizes without requiring changes to the physical infrastructure. The solution uses Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches in conjunction with the Cisco non-blocking multicast (NBM) algorithm (an intelligent traffic management algorithm) and with or without the Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC) IP for Media Fabric (IPFM) to provide a highly reliable (zero drop multicast), highly visible, highly secure, and highly available network. Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media solution supports the following types of deployments: ● Spine-leaf topology—A single or multi-spine deployment method with variable flow size that allows the NBM fabric to form a multicast flow. ● Single modular switch—An architecture suitable for fixed deployments, with the controller providing features such as flow visibility, security, and monitoring. New Hardware Features The following new hardware are introduced in Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(2)F for deployment in IP Fabric for Media solution: ● N9K-C93108TC-FX3 – This is a Top of Rack (TOR) L3 switch with total of 54 ports. 48 (Downlink port) supports 100M/1G/10GT and 6 (Uplink port) supports 40G/100G QSFP28. ● N9K-C93400LD-H1 – This is a 9300 chassis fabric module with total of 52 ports. 48 ports support 50G SFP56 and 4 ports support 400G QSFP-DD ports.

Online History Change Date Description August 19, 2022 Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(1)F became available. IP Fabric for Media Today, the broadcast industry uses a serial digital interface (SDI) router and SDI cables to transport video and audio traffic. The SDI cables can carry only a single unidirectional signal. As a result, many cables, frequently stretched over long distances, is required, making it difficult and time-consuming to expand or change an SDI-based infrastructure. Cisco’s IP fabric for media solution helps transition from an SDI router to an IP-based infrastructure. In an IP-based infrastructure, a single cable has the capacity to carry multiple bidirectional traffic flows and can support different flow sizes without requiring changes to the physical infrastructure. The solution uses Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches in conjunction with the Cisco non-blocking multicast (NBM) algorithm (an intelligent traffic management algorithm) and with or without the Cisco DCNM Media Controller to provide a highly reliable (zero drop multicast), highly visible, highly secure, and highly available network. Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 10.3(1)F supports two deployment methods: ● Spine-leaf topology—A single or multi-spine deployment method with variable flow size that allows the NBM fabric to form a multicast flow. ● Single modular switch—An architecture suitable for fixed deployments, with the controller providing features such as flow visibility, security, and monitoring. New Hardware Features The following new hardware are introduced in Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(1)F for deployment in IP Fabric for Media solution: ● N9K-C9808 16-RU modular switch with slots for up to 8 line cards in addition to two supervisors, 8 fabric modules, 4 fan trays, and up to 9 power supplies. ● N9K-X9836DM-A a 36-port 400-Gigabit Ethernet QSFP-DD line card for Cisco Nexus 9800 family switches. ● N9K-C9808-FM-A a Fabric module for Nexus 9808 chassis.

Feature Description IPFM VPC Support VPC is supported with feature NBM. Open Issues There are no open issues in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 10.3(1)F. Resolved Issues There are no resolved issues in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 10.3(1)F. Limitations When using ASM (IGMPv2), the bandwidth is reserved between the receiver leaf switch and the spine switch even when the sender is local to the receiver leaf switch. NBM static OIF can include an SVI; however, an IGMP snooping entry must be manually created to force the traffic out of the Layer 2 physical interface. To prevent packet drops for NBM flows, configure 5% more bandwidth than the traffic being sent. Upgrade Instructions Follow these steps to upgrade from a Cisco NX-OS 7.x or 9.x release to Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(1)F in an IP fabric for media deployment. Note: For Cisco Nexus 9504 and 9508 switches with -R line cards, you must upgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)F3(4) to a 10.x release. 1. Shut down the endpoint-facing ports on the switches. 2. Disable NBM (using the no feature nbm command). 3. Disable the ip pim pre-build-spt force command on the spine switches in your fabric. 4. Disable PIM passive mode (using the no ip pim passive command). 5. Upgrade the switch software from 7.x or 9.x to 10.3(x). 6. For Cisco Nexus 9504 and 9508 switches with -R line cards, configure these TCAM carving commands in the following order and then reload the switch: hardware access-list tcam region redirect_v6 0 hardware access-list tcam region ing-nbm 2048 7. Upgrade DCNM. 8. Configure PIM and MSDP, if applicable. 9. Enable NBM (using the feature nbm command). 10. Configure NBM policies using the CLI or DCNM. (See the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series IP Fabric for Media Solution Guide, Release 10.3(x). ) 11. If you're not using DCNM, disable IGMP static OIF and create an NBM flow definition to establish a flow. 12. Re-enable all ports facing the endpoints. 13. On configuring \"feature nbm\", DEFAULT VRF will not come in any PMN mode (pim-active/passive). You must configure it explicitly using command \"nbm mode pim-active\"/\"nbm mode pim-passive\" under Default VRF. 14. On configuring NBM non-default VRF using \"nbm vrf <foo>\", NON-DEFAULT VRF will not come in any PMN mode (pim-active/passive). You must configure it explicitly using command \"nbm mode pim-active\"/\"nbm mode pim-passive\" under Non-Default VRF.

Online History Change Date Description April 26, 2022 Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(3)F became available. IP Fabric for Media Today, the broadcast industry uses a serial digital interface (SDI) router and SDI cables to transport video and audio traffic. The SDI cables can carry only a single unidirectional signal. As a result, many cables, frequently stretched over long distances, is required, making it difficult and time-consuming to expand or change an SDI-based infrastructure. Cisco’s IP fabric for media solution helps transition from an SDI router to an IP-based infrastructure. In an IP-based infrastructure, a single cable has the capacity to carry multiple bidirectional traffic flows and can support different flow sizes without requiring changes to the physical infrastructure. The solution uses Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches in conjunction with the Cisco non-blocking multicast (NBM) algorithm (an intelligent traffic management algorithm) and with or without the Cisco DCNM Media Controller to provide a highly reliable (zero drop multicast), highly visible, highly secure, and highly available network. Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 10.2(2)F supports two deployment methods: ● Spine-leaf topology—A single or multi-spine deployment method with variable flow size that allows the NBM fabric to form a multicast flow. ● Single modular switch—An architecture suitable for fixed deployments, with the controller providing features such as flow visibility, security, and monitoring.

PMN PIM Passive Multicast to Unicast NAT PMN support for Multicast to Unicast NAT in PIM-Passive mode. IGMP SG Host Proxy in PIM Passive mode PMN support for IGMP SG Host Proxy in PIM-Passive mode. PMN PIM Active Unicast to Multicast NAT PMN support for Unicast to Multicast NAT in PIM-Active mode. PMN PIM Passive Unicast to Multicast NAT PMN support for Unicast to Multicast NAT in PIM-Passive mode. Open Issues There are no open issues in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 10.2(2)F. Resolved Issues There are no resolved issues in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 10.2(2)F. Limitations When using ASM (IGMPv2), the bandwidth is reserved between the receiver leaf switch and the spine switch even when the sender is local to the receiver leaf switch. NBM static OIF can include an SVI; however, an IGMP snooping entry must be manually created to force the traffic out of the Layer 2 physical interface. To prevent packet drops for NBM flows, configure 5% more bandwidth than the traffic being sent. Upgrade Instructions Follow these steps to upgrade from a Cisco NX-OS 7.x or 9.x release to Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(2)F in an IP fabric for media deployment. Note: For Cisco Nexus 9504 and 9508 switches with -R line cards, you must upgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)F3(4) to a 10.x release. 1. Shut down the endpoint-facing ports on the switches. 2. Disable NBM (using the no feature nbm command). 3. Disable the ip pim pre-build-spt force command on the spine switches in your fabric. 4. Disable PIM passive mode (using the no ip pim passive command). 5. Upgrade the switch software from 7.x or 9.x to 10.1(1). 6. For Cisco Nexus 9504 and 9508 switches with -R line cards, configure these TCAM carving commands in the following order and then reload the switch: hardware access-list tcam region redirect_v6 0 hardware access-list tcam region ing-nbm 2048 7. Upgrade DCNM. 8. Configure PIM and MSDP, if applicable. 9. Enable NBM (using the feature nbm command). 10. Configure NBM policies using the CLI or DCNM. (See the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series IP Fabric for Media Solution Guide, Release 10.1(x). ) 11. If you're not using DCNM, disable IGMP static OIF and create an NBM flow definition to establish a flow. 12. Re-enable all ports facing the endpoints. 13. On configuring \"feature nbm\", DEFAULT VRF will not come in any PMN mode (pim-active/passive). You must configure it explicitly using command \"nbm mode pim-active\"/\"nbm mode pim-passive\" under Default VRF. 14. On configuring NBM non-default VRF using \"nbm vrf <foo>\", NON-DEFAULT VRF will not come in any PMN mode (pim-active/passive). You must configure it explicitly using command \"nbm mode pim-active\"/\"nbm mode pim-passive\" under Non-Default VRF.

Online History Change Date Description May 14, 2021 Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(2) became available. IP Fabric for Media Today, the broadcast industry uses a serial digital interface (SDI) router and SDI cables to transport video and audio traffic. The SDI cables can carry only a single unidirectional signal. As a result, many cables, frequently stretched over long distances, is required, making it difficult and time-consuming to expand or change an SDI-based infrastructure. Cisco’s IP fabric for media solution helps transition from an SDI router to an IP-based infrastructure. In an IP-based infrastructure, a single cable has the capacity to carry multiple bidirectional traffic flows and can support different flow sizes without requiring changes to the physical infrastructure. The solution uses Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches in conjunction with the Cisco non-blocking multicast (NBM) algorithm (an intelligent traffic management algorithm) and with or without the Cisco DCNM Media Controller to provide a highly reliable (zero drop multicast), highly visible, highly secure, and highly available network. Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 10.1(2) supports two deployment methods: ● Spine-leaf topology—A single or multi-spine deployment method with variable flow size that allows the NBM fabric to form a multicast flow. ● Single modular switch—An architecture suitable for fixed deployments, with the controller providing features such as flow visibility, security, and monitoring.

Open Issues There are no open issues in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 10.1(2). Resolved Issues There are no resolved issues in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 10.1(2). Limitations When using ASM (IGMPv2), the bandwidth is reserved between the receiver leaf switch and the spine switch even when the sender is local to the receiver leaf switch. NBM static OIF can include an SVI; however, an IGMP snooping entry must be manually created to force the traffic out of the Layer 2 physical interface. To prevent packet drops for NBM flows, configure 5% more bandwidth than the traffic being sent. Upgrade Instructions Follow these steps to upgrade from a Cisco NX-OS 7.x or 9.x release to Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(2) in an IP fabric for media deployment. Note: For Cisco Nexus 9504 and 9508 switches with -R line cards, you must upgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)F3(4) to a 10.x release. 1. Shut down the endpoint-facing ports on the switches. 2. Disable NBM (using the no feature nbm command). 3. Disable the ip pim pre-build-spt force command on the spine switches in your fabric. 4. Disable PIM passive mode (using the no ip pim passive command). 5. Upgrade the switch software from 7.x or 9.x to 10.1(1). 6. For Cisco Nexus 9504 and 9508 switches with -R line cards, configure these TCAM carving commands in the following order and then reload the switch: hardware access-list tcam region redirect_v6 0 hardware access-list tcam region ing-nbm 2048 7. Upgrade DCNM. 8. Configure PIM and MSDP, if applicable. 9. Enable NBM (using the feature nbm command). 10. Configure NBM policies using the CLI or DCNM. (See the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series IP Fabric for Media Solution Guide, Release 10.1(x). ) 11. If you're not using DCNM, disable IGMP static OIF and create an NBM flow definition to establish a flow. 12. Re-enable all ports facing the endpoints.

Open Issues There are no open issues in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 10.2(2)F. Resolved Issues There are no resolved issues in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 10.2(2)F. Limitations When using ASM (IGMPv2), the bandwidth is reserved between the receiver leaf switch and the spine switch even when the sender is local to the receiver leaf switch. NBM static OIF can include an SVI; however, an IGMP snooping entry must be manually created to force the traffic out of the Layer 2 physical interface. To prevent packet drops for NBM flows, configure 5% more bandwidth than the traffic being sent. Upgrade Instructions Follow these steps to upgrade from a Cisco NX-OS 7.x or 9.x release to Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(2)F in an IP fabric for media deployment. Note: For Cisco Nexus 9504 and 9508 switches with -R line cards, you must upgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)F3(4) to a 10.x release. 1. Shut down the endpoint-facing ports on the switches. 2. Disable NBM (using the no feature nbm command). 3. Disable the ip pim pre-build-spt force command on the spine switches in your fabric. 4. Disable PIM passive mode (using the no ip pim passive command). 5. Upgrade the switch software from 7.x or 9.x to 10.1(1). 6. For Cisco Nexus 9504 and 9508 switches with -R line cards, configure these TCAM carving commands in the following order and then reload the switch: hardware access-list tcam region redirect_v6 0 hardware access-list tcam region ing-nbm 2048 7. Upgrade DCNM. 8. Configure PIM and MSDP, if applicable. 9. Enable NBM (using the feature nbm command). 10. Configure NBM policies using the CLI or DCNM. (See the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series IP Fabric for Media Solution Guide, Release 10.1(x). ) 11. If you're not using DCNM, disable IGMP static OIF and create an NBM flow definition to establish a flow. 12. Re-enable all ports facing the endpoints. 13. On configuring \"feature nbm\", DEFAULT VRF will not come in any PMN mode (pim-active/passive). You must configure it explicitly using command \"nbm mode pim-active\"/\"nbm mode pim-passive\" under Default VRF. 14. On configuring NBM non-default VRF using \"nbm vrf <foo>\", NON-DEFAULT VRF will not come in any PMN mode (pim-active/passive). You must configure it explicitly using command \"nbm mode pim-active\"/\"nbm mode pim-passive\" under Non-Default VRF.

Introduction This document describes the Cisco IP fabric for media solution, new hardware, software features, upgrade instructions, and caveats for Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(3)F software for use on Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches. Table 1. Online History Change: Date Description March 28, 2024 Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(3)F became available IP Fabric for Media Today, the broadcast industry uses a serial digital interface (SDI) router and SDI cables to transport video and audio traffic. The SDI cables can carry only a single unidirectional signal. As a result, many cables, frequently stretched over long distances, are required, making it difficult and time-consuming to expand or change an SDI-based infrastructure. Cisco’s IP fabric for media solution helps transition from an SDI router to an IP-based infrastructure. In an IP-based infrastructure, a single cable can carry multiple bidirectional traffic flows and can support different flow sizes without requiring changes to the physical infrastructure. The solution uses Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches in conjunction with the Cisco non-blocking multicast (NBM) algorithm (an intelligent traffic management algorithm) and with or without the Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC) IP for Media Fabric (IPFM) to provide a highly reliable (zero drop multicast), highly visible, highly secure, and highly available network. Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media solution supports the following types of deployments: ● Spine-leaf topology—A single or multi-spine deployment method with variable flow size that allows the NBM fabric to form a multicast flow. ● Single modular switch—An architecture suitable for fixed deployments, with the controller providing features such as flow visibility, security, and monitoring. New Hardware Features The following new hardware are introduced in Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(3)F for deployment in IP Fabric for Media solution: ● N9K-C9364C-H1 – 2-RU fixed-port, spine and leaf, L2/L3 switch, which is designed for deployment in data centers. This switch has 64 100G QSFP28 and 2 10G SFP+ ports. Supported Device Hardware Table 2 lists the hardware that the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 10.4(3)F supports.

Feature Description Per-Interface Unicast Bandwidth Reservation The Unicast bandwidth (BW) is currently managed only at the fabric level. There is no provision to granularly reserve bandwidth for unicast per port. In case of multisite scenario, there is a need for a config knob which can manage the unicast bandwidth per port. The new config knob that is introduced reserves the unicast bandwidth on a per port basis. A corresponding configuration Model Object (MO) is provided to provision the unicast bandwidth reservation. Open Issues There are no open issues in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 10.1(1). Resolved Issues There are no resolved issues in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 10.1(1). Limitations When using ASM (IGMPv2), the bandwidth is reserved between the receiver leaf switch and the spine switch even when the sender is local to the receiver leaf switch. NBM static OIF can include an SVI; however, an IGMP snooping entry must be manually created to force the traffic out of the Layer 2 physical interface. To prevent packet drops for NBM flows, configure 5% more bandwidth than the traffic being sent. Upgrade Instructions Follow these steps to upgrade from a Cisco NX-OS 7.x or 9.x release to Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(1) in an IP fabric for media deployment. Note: For Cisco Nexus 9504 and 9508 switches with -R line cards, you must upgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)F3(4) to a 10.x release. 1. Shut down the endpoint-facing ports on the switches. 2. Disable NBM (using the no feature nbm command). 3. Disable the ip pim pre-build-spt force command on the spine switches in your fabric. 4. Disable PIM passive mode (using the no ip pim passive command). 5. Upgrade the switch software from 7.x or 9.x to 10.1(1). 6. For Cisco Nexus 9504 and 9508 switches with -R line cards, configure these TCAM carving commands in the following order and then reload the switch: hardware access-list tcam region redirect_v6 0 hardware access-list tcam region ing-nbm 2048 7. Upgrade DCNM. 8. Configure PIM and MSDP, if applicable. 9. Enable NBM (using the feature nbm command). 10. Configure NBM policies using the CLI or DCNM. (See the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series IP Fabric for Media Solution Guide, Release 10.1(x). ) 11. If you're not using DCNM, disable IGMP static OIF and create an NBM flow definition to establish a flow. 12. Re-enable all ports facing the endpoints.

Online History Change Date Description March 11, 2021 Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(7) became available. IP Fabric for Media Today, the broadcast industry uses a serial digital interface (SDI) router and SDI cables to transport video and audio traffic. The SDI cables can carry only a single unidirectional signal. As a result, many cables, frequently stretched over long distances, is required, making it difficult and time-consuming to expand or change an SDI-based infrastructure. Cisco’s IP fabric for media solution helps transition from an SDI router to an IP-based infrastructure. In an IP-based infrastructure, a single cable has the capacity to carry multiple bidirectional traffic flows and can support different flow sizes without requiring changes to the physical infrastructure. The solution uses Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches in conjunction with the Cisco non-blocking multicast (NBM) algorithm (an intelligent traffic management algorithm) and with or without the Cisco DCNM Media Controller to provide a highly reliable (zero drop multicast), highly visible, highly secure, and highly available network. Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 9.3(7) supports two deployment methods: ● Spine-leaf topology—A single or multi-spine deployment method with variable flow size that allows the NBM fabric to form a multicast flow. ● Single modular switch—An architecture suitable for fixed deployments, with the controller providing features such as flow visibility, security, and monitoring.

When using ASM (IGMPv2), the bandwidth is reserved between the receiver leaf switch and the spine switch even when the sender is local to the receiver leaf switch. NBM static OIF can include an SVI; however, an IGMP snooping entry must be manually created to force the traffic out of the Layer 2 physical interface. To prevent packet drops for NBM flows, configure 5% more bandwidth than the traffic being sent. Follow these steps to upgrade from a Cisco NX-OS 7.x or 9.x release to Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(6) in an IP fabric for media deployment. Note:For Cisco Nexus 9504 and 9508 switches with -R line cards, you must upgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)F3(4) to a 9.x release. 1.Shut down the endpoint-facing ports on the switches. 2.Disable NBM (using theno feature nbmcommand). 3.Disable theip pim pre-build-spt forcecommand on the spine switches in your fabric. 4.Disable PIM passive mode (using theno ip pim passivecommand). 5.Upgrade the switch software from 7.x or 9.x to 9.3(5). 6.For Cisco Nexus 9504 and 9508 switches with -R line cards, configure these TCAM carving commands in the following order and then reload the switch: hardware access-list tcam region redirect_v6 0hardware access-list tcam region ing-nbm 2048 7.Upgrade DCNM. 8.Configure PIM and MSDP, if applicable. 9.Enable NBM (using thefeature nbmcommand). 10.Configure NBM policies using the CLI or DCNM.

Online History Change Date Description August 06, 2021 Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(8) became available. IP Fabric for Media Today, the broadcast industry uses a serial digital interface (SDI) router and SDI cables to transport video and audio traffic. The SDI cables can carry only a single unidirectional signal. As a result, many cables, frequently stretched over long distances, is required, making it difficult and time-consuming to expand or change an SDI-based infrastructure. Cisco’s IP fabric for media solution helps transition from an SDI router to an IP-based infrastructure. In an IP-based infrastructure, a single cable has the capacity to carry multiple bidirectional traffic flows and can support different flow sizes without requiring changes to the physical infrastructure. The solution uses Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches in conjunction with the Cisco non-blocking multicast (NBM) algorithm (an intelligent traffic management algorithm) and with or without the Cisco DCNM Media Controller to provide a highly reliable (zero drop multicast), highly visible, highly secure, and highly available network. Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 9.3(8) supports two deployment methods: ● Spine-leaf topology—A single or multi-spine deployment method with variable flow size that allows the NBM fabric to form a multicast flow. ● Single modular switch—An architecture suitable for fixed deployments, with the controller providing features such as flow visibility, security, and monitoring.

When using ASM (IGMPv2), the bandwidth is reserved between the receiver leaf switch and the spine switch even when the sender is local to the receiver leaf switch. NBM static OIF can include an SVI; however, an IGMP snooping entry must be manually created to force the traffic out of the Layer 2 physical interface. To prevent packet drops for NBM flows, configure 5% more bandwidth than the traffic being sent. Follow these steps to upgrade from a Cisco NX-OS 7.x or 9.x release to Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(5) in an IP fabric for media deployment.

Online History Change Date Description Feburary 08, 2022 Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(9) became available. IP Fabric for Media Today, the broadcast industry uses a serial digital interface (SDI) router and SDI cables to transport video and audio traffic. The SDI cables can carry only a single unidirectional signal. As a result, many cables, frequently stretched over long distances, is required, making it difficult and time-consuming to expand or change an SDI-based infrastructure. Cisco’s IP fabric for media solution helps transition from an SDI router to an IP-based infrastructure. In an IP-based infrastructure, a single cable has the capacity to carry multiple bidirectional traffic flows and can support different flow sizes without requiring changes to the physical infrastructure. The solution uses Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches in conjunction with the Cisco non-blocking multicast (NBM) algorithm (an intelligent traffic management algorithm) and with or without the Cisco DCNM Media Controller to provide a highly reliable (zero drop multicast), highly visible, highly secure, and highly available network. Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 9.3(9) supports two deployment methods: ● Spine-leaf topology—A single or multi-spine deployment method with variable flow size that allows the NBM fabric to form a multicast flow. ● Single modular switch—An architecture suitable for fixed deployments, with the controller providing features such as flow visibility, security, and monitoring.

In this mode, the switch cannot accept any NBM configurations, such as flow policy or host policy. The switch does not participate in any flow-stitching decisions and strictly follows the API calls from the controller. See theCisco Nexus NX-API References for APIdetails.

When using ASM (IGMPv2), the bandwidth is reserved between the receiver leaf switch and the spine switch even when the sender is local to the receiver leaf switch. NBM static OIF can include an SVI; however, an IGMP snooping entry must be manually created to force the traffic out of the Layer 2 physical interface. To prevent packet drops for NBM flows, configure 5% more bandwidth than the traffic being sent. Follow these steps to upgrade from a Cisco NX-OS 7.x or 9.x release to Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(3) in an IP fabric for media deployment. Note:For Cisco Nexus 9504 and 9508 switches with -R line cards, you must upgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)F3(4) to a 9.x release. 1.Shut down the endpoint-facing ports on the switches. 2.Disable NBM (using theno feature nbmcommand). 3.Disable theip pim pre-build-spt forcecommand on the spine switches in your fabric. 4.Disable PIM passive mode (using theno ip pim passivecommand). 5.Upgrade the switch software from 7.x or 9.x to 9.3(3). 6.For Cisco Nexus 9504 and 9508 switches with -R line cards, configure these TCAM carving commands in the following order and then reload the switch: hardware access-list tcam region redirect_v6 0hardware access-list tcam region ing-nbm 2048 7.Upgrade DCNM. 8.Configure PIM and MSDP, if applicable. 9.Enable NBM (using thefeature nbmcommand). 10.Configure NBM policies using the CLI or DCNM.

Contents IP Fabric for Media.3 New Software Features.4 Open Caveats.5 Resolved Caveats.5 Limitations.5 Upgrade Instructions.6 Related Documentation.6 Obtaining Documentation and Submitting a Service Request.7  Today, the broadcast industry uses a serial digital interface (SDI) router and SDI cables to transport video and audio traffic. The SDI cables can carry only a single unidirectional signal. As a result, many cables, frequently stretched over long distances, is required, making it difficult and time-consuming to expand or change an SDI-based infrastructure. Cisco’s IP fabric for media solution helps transition from an SDI router to an IP-based infrastructure. In an IP-based infrastructure, a single cable has the capacity to carry multiple bidirectional traffic flows and can support different flow sizes without requiring changes to the physical infrastructure. The solution uses Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches in conjunction with the Cisco non-blocking multicast (NBM) algorithm (an intelligent traffic management algorithm) and  with or without the Cisco DCNM Media Controller to provide a highly reliable (zero drop multicast), highly visible, highly secure, and highly available network. Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 9.3(1) supports two deployment methods: ·Spine-leaf topology—A single or multi-spine deployment method with variable flow size that allows the NBM fabric to form a multicast flow. ·Single modular switch—An architecture suitable for fixed deployments, with the controller providing features such as flow visibility, security, and monitoring.

NBM VRFs support multi-tenancy at the fabric level, allowing multiple customers to leverage the same IP fabric for media infrastructure simultaneously. NBM VRFs are independent of the default VRF and support all existing commands. Each VRF has its own set of policies.  ■Policing, DSCP remarking, and flow statistics-Added support for Cisco Nexus 9504 and 9508 switches with -R line cards. ■RTP flow monitoring-Introduced this feature for Cisco Nexus 9300-FX and 9300-FX2 switches. RTP flow monitoring caches RTP flows on the switch and detects any gaps in the RTP sequence number, which indicates a loss in RTP frames. This information helps to pinpoint where the loss is occurring and enables you to better plan hardware resources.

Using a wildcard allows you to detect all hosts that are sending or receiving multicast traffic on a particular group or mask using a single configuration. ■NBM flow definition-Added the ability to establish flows by defining an NBM flow, rather than by configuring IGMP static OIF. NBM exposes a CLI and an API to provision flows to receivers when they do not use IGMP to signal their interest in joining or leaving a flow. You can program a flow to go all the way to the receiver leaf, in order to pre-reserve the network bandwidth, or direct the leaf switch to send the traffic to the receiver by specifying the egress interface.  ■NBM flow policies-Added the ability to disable the policer for NBM flow policies. By default, each source flow uses a policer on the source leaf (the first hop router). When the number of multicast source flows exceeds the number of policers, the flow is not accepted by the source leaf. To override this behavior, you can disable the policer under the flow policy. ■PIM-Removed the requirement to prebuild the shortest path tree (SPT) for known (S,G) routes using theip pim pre-build-spt forcecommand.

Contents IP Fabric for Media.3 New Hardware Features.4 New Software Features.5 Open Caveats.5 Resolved Caveats.6 Limitations.6 Upgrade Instructions.6 Related Documentation.7 Obtaining Documentation and Submitting a Service Request.7  Today, the broadcast industry uses a serial digital interface (SDI) router and SDI cables to transport video and audio traffic. The SDI cables can carry only a single unidirectional signal. As a result, many cables, frequently stretched over long distances, is required, making it difficult and time-consuming to expand or change an SDI-based infrastructure. Cisco’s IP fabric for media solution helps transition from an SDI router to an IP-based infrastructure. In an IP-based infrastructure, a single cable has the capacity to carry multiple bidirectional traffic flows and can support different flow sizes without requiring changes to the physical infrastructure. The solution uses Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches in conjunction with the Cisco non-blocking multicast (NBM) algorithm (an intelligent traffic management algorithm) and  with or without the Cisco DCNM Media Controller to provide a highly reliable (zero drop multicast), highly visible, highly secure, and highly available network. Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 9.2(1) supports two deployment methods: ·Spine-leaf topology—A single or multi-spine deployment method with variable flow size that allows the NBM fabric to form a multicast flow. ·Single modular switch—An architecture suitable for fixed deployments, with the controller providing features such as flow visibility, security, and monitoring. Table 2 lists the hardware that the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 9.2(1) supports.

This section lists the new software features in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 9.2(1). ■Flow bandwidth-Added the ability to configure the flow bandwidth and flow policy bandwidth in Kbps, Mbps, or Gbps and changed the default value to 0. ■Host policies-Added the ability to configure policies within NBM for senders, local receivers, and external receivers. ■Multisite-This feature provides a reliable channel of communication between multiple sites, where the sender is in one site and receivers are in another site. You can configure some external (or host-side) interfaces as external links and attach external devices to those links to create a multisite solution. By configuring some interfaces as external links, the solution can perform bandwidth management on those interfaces. Switches running in PIM active mode manage the fabric bandwidth through a distributed bandwidth management algorithm running on all switches.

Table1 Online History Change Date Description November 22, 2017 Created the release notes for Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 7.0(3)I7(2).  Contents IP Fabric for Media.3 Supported Device Hardware.3 New Hardware Features.4 New Software Features.4 Open Caveats.5 Limitations.5 Upgrade and Downgrade Instructions.5 Related Documentation.5 Obtaining Documentation and Submitting a Service Request.6  Today, the broadcast industry uses a serial digital interface (SDI) router and SDI cables to transport video and audio traffic. The SDI cables can carry only a single unidirectional signal. As a result, many cables, frequently stretched over long distances, is required, making it difficult and time-consuming to expand or change an SDI-based infrastructure. Cisco’s IP fabric for media solution helps transition from an SDI router to an IP-based infrastructure. In an IP-based infrastructure, a single cable has the capacity to carry multiple bidirectional traffic flows and can support different flow sizes without requiring changes to the physical infrastructure. The solution uses Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches in conjunction with the Cisco non-blocking multicast (NBM) algorithm (an intelligent traffic management algorithm) and with or without the Cisco DCNM Media Controller to provide a highly reliable (zero drop multicast), highly visible, highly secure, and highly available network. Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 7.0(3)I7(2) supports three deployment methods: ·A spine-leaf topology with the DCNM Media Controller—A flexible architecture for large-scale deployments typically seen in an IP studio ·A single modular switch with the DCNM Media Controller—An architecture suitable for fixed deployments, with the controller providing features such as flow visibility, security, and monitoring ·A single modular switch without the DCNM Media Controller—A simple deployment method for environments such as outside broadcasting (OB) vans Table 2 lists the hardware that the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 7.0(3)I7(2) supports.

Multiple border leafs in a given site are not supported. A dynamic bandwidth change, in regards to the IP Fabric for Media bandwidth calculation, for an interface is not supported. For the bandwidth to take effect, an interface flap is needed and the new bandwidth is taken into consideration only after the interface comes up with the new bandwidth. If you want to migrate from Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I4(2), you must upgrade your switches to Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I7(2) and completely change the configuration as the switches need to be reconfigured in NBM controller mode. You also need to modify the TCAM allocation. Because most deployments are built using redundant networks, with minimal or no disruption to production, each side of the fabric can be upgraded one after the other.

Contents IP Fabric for Media.3 Supported Device Hardware.3 Required Software.4 Open Caveats.4 Upgrade and Downgrade Instructions.4 Related Documentation.4 Obtaining Documentation and Submitting a Service Request.5  Today, the broadcast industry uses a serial digital interface (SDI) router and SDI cables to transport video and audio traffic. The SDI cables can carry only a single unidirectional signal. As a result, a large number of cables, frequently stretched over long distances, is required, making it difficult and time-consuming to expand or change an SDI-based infrastructure. Cisco’s IP fabric for media solution helps transition from an SDI router to an IP-based infrastructure. In an IP-based infrastructure, a single cable has the capacity to carry multiple bidirectional traffic flows and can support different flow sizes without requiring changes to the physical infrastructure. The solution uses Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches in conjunction with the Cisco non-blocking multicast (NBM) algorithm (an intelligent traffic management algorithm) and with or without the Cisco DCNM Media Controller to provide a highly reliable (zero drop multicast), highly visible, highly secure, and highly available network. Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 7.0(3)I6(1) supports three deployment methods: ·A spine-leaf topology with the DCNM Media Controller—A flexible architecture for large-scale deployments typically seen in an IP studio ·A single modular switch with the DCNM Media Controller—An architecture suitable for fixed deployments, with the controller providing features such as flow visibility, security, and monitoring ·A single modular switch without the DCNM Media Controller—A simple deployment method for environments such as outside broadcasting (OB) vans Table 2 lists the hardware that the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP Fabric for Media Release 7.0(3)I6(1) supports.

It enables you to configure a Cisco Nexus 9300 or 9300-EX platform switch for Layer 2 VXLAN from an external controller using JSON-RPC NX-API calls. NXDB is enabled on the switch using Cisco NX-OS. The Open vSwitch Database (OVSDB) management protocol, as defined in RFC 7047, is a configuration protocol that allows the external controller and the Cisco Nexus 9300 or 9300-EX platform switch to communicate with one another. Cisco NX-OS does not natively support the OVSDB protocol, so an intermediate agent is needed to accept the OVSDB messages sent from the external controller and make the appropriate JSON-RPC NX-API calls. For this purpose, a separate OVSDB plugin is available that can be run either in the Guest Shell container or on an individual Linux server that is connected to the switch.

It enables you to configure a Cisco Nexus 9300 or 9300-EX platform switch for Layer 2 VXLAN from an external controller using JSON-RPC NX-API calls. NXDB is enabled on the switch using Cisco NX-OS. The Open vSwitch Database (OVSDB) management protocol, as defined in RFC 7047, is a configuration protocol that allows the external controller and the Cisco Nexus 9300 or 9300-EX platform switch to communicate with one another.

This document lists the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. The following table lists the changes to this document. Date Description June 7, 2017 Created the release notes for Release 12.3(1). August 2, 2017 Corrected images for the N9K-C9508-FM-E fabric module.  The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI-mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco ACI In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download them fromhttp://www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at this time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco ACI operating system and include the following hardware: ·Supervisor modules (2)—each with at least 800 MB of available bootflash memory (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) ·System controller modules (2) (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) ·Line cards (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) oCisco Nexus 9504 switch (1-4 modules) oCisco Nexus 9508 switch (1-8 modules) oCisco Nexus 9516 switch (1-16 modules) ·Fabric modules (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) oFabric modules for 40-Gigabit line cards on a Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, or 9516 switch (3-6) oFabric modules for 100-Gigabit line cards on a Cisco Nexus 9504 or 9508 switch (4) ·Fan modules oCisco Nexus 93120TX switch (2) oCisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switch (3) oCisco Nexus 93108TC-EX, 93108TC-FX, 93180LC-EX, 93180YC-EX, 93180YC-FX, 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372PX-E, 9372TX, or 9372TX-E switch (4) oCisco Nexus 9504, 9508, or 9516 switch (3) ·Power supplies—The following table lists the number and type supported by each switch.

This document lists the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. The following table lists the changes to this document. Date Description January 17, 2016 Created the release notes for Release 12.2(1n).  The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI-mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco ACI In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download them fromhttp://www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at this time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco ACI operating system and include the following hardware: ·Supervisor modules (2)—each with at least 800 MB of available bootflash memory (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) ·System controller modules (2) (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) ·I/O modules (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) oCisco Nexus 9504 switch (1-4 modules) oCisco Nexus 9508 switch (1-8 modules) oCisco Nexus 9516 switch (1-10 modules) ·Fabric modules (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) oFabric modules for 40-Gigabit I/O modules on a Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, or 9516 switch (3-6) oFabric modules for 100-Gigabit I/O modules on a Cisco Nexus 9504 or 9508 switch (4) ·Fan modules oCisco Nexus 93120TX switch (2) oCisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switch (3) oCisco Nexus 93108TC-EX, 93180LC-EX, 93180YC-EX, 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372PX-E, 9372TX, or 9372TX-E switch (4) oCisco Nexus 9504, 9508, or 9516 switch (3) ·Power supplies o650-W AC power supplies (2) or 930-W DC power supplies (2) for the Cisco Nexus 93108TC-EX, 93180YC-EX, 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372PX-E, 9372TX, 9372TX-E, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches o1200-W AC power supplies (2) or 930-W DC power supplies (2) for the Cisco Nexus 93120TX and 9336PQ switches o1200-W HVAC/HVDC power supplies (2) for the Cisco Nexus  93108TC-EX, 93120TX, 93128TX, and 93180YC-EX switches o3000-W power supplies (AC, Universal AC/DC, or DC) for Cisco Nexus 9500 switches §Cisco Nexus 9504 switch (up to 4) §Cisco Nexus 9508 switch (up to 8) §Cisco Nexus 9516 switch (up to 10) ·Uplink module (Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches only) oM6PQ oM6PQ-E oM12PQ You must have administrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch.

In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco ACI In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download them fromhttp://www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at this time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart upgrade.

This document lists the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. The following table lists the changes to this document. Date Description October 2, 2016 Created the release notes for Release 12.1(1x). November 2, 2016 Added PIDs for Cisco Nexus 93108TC-EX and 93180YC-EX in table. November 29, 2016 Updated EPLD images for the N9K-X9732C-EX line card and Cisco Nexus 9372PX-E switch.  The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI-mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware.

This document lists the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. The following table lists the changes to this document. Date Description July 1, 2016 Created the release notes for Release 12.0(1x). July 21, 2016 Updated the IOFPGA image for the N9K-X9732C-EX line card. November 2, 2016 Included images for Cisco Nexus 93180YC-EX switch.  The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI-mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco ACI In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download them fromhttp://www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at this time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart upgrade.

PLDs include electronic programmable\n\t\tlogic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex\n\t\tprogrammable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this\n\t\tdocument, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of\n\t\thaving EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those\n\t\tfunctions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their\n\t\thardware. EPLD image upgrades\n\t\t  for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the\n\t\t  module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD\n\t\t  upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only\n\t\t  the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the\n\t\tlatest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as\n\t\tprovided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated.\n\t\tThese EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD\n\t\timage upgrades are independent from the Cisco ACI In Service Software Upgrade\n\t\t(ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact\n\t\ton the network environment. When Cisco makes an\n\t\tEPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability,\n\t\tand you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended\n\t\tif your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level\n\t\tof traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at\n\t\tthis time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should\n\t\t  execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The\n\t\t  system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart\n\t\t  upgrade.

FPGA/EPLD Upgrade Precedure to Address Secure Boot Vulnerability  This document describes how to update the EPLD using the Generic EPLD update image for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches and Cisco Nexus 3000 Series switches running 7.0(3)I4(x), 7.0(3)I7(1) to 7.0(3)I7(6) and 9.2(1) to 9.2(3) to address the Secure Boot Vulnerability detailedhere. This EPLD update is a complimentary update to whatever EPLD software that shipped with the respective software, and hence can be additively applied to these versions. The update images are listed below and should be available against the ‘NX-OS EPLD Updates’ section of the latest maintenance release for each of the above trains. ■For Cisco Nexus 9000 and 3000 Series switches - n9000-epld-secure-boot-update.img For the affected switches mentioned inTable 1. Vulnerable Products addressed in Security Advisory (cisco-sa-20190513-secureboot) Note:9.3(1), 9.2(4) and 7.0(3)I7(7), will have this complimentary update built into their EPLD release update, and hence no need to apply this complimentary EPLD update. Please follow thislinkfor N9K-C93180LC-EX Table of Contents Introduction3 Deciding When to Upgrade EPLDs3 Switch Requirements3 EPLD Upgrades Available for NX-OS Mode Releases 7.0(3)I4(x) through 9.2(x)5 Nexus 9000 Series Switches5 Nexus 3000 Series Switches6 Cisco Secure Boot Hardware Tampering Vulnerability - Remediation Steps6 Downloading the EPLD Images11 Installation Guidelines12 Upgrading the EPLD Images13 Verifying the EPLD Upgrades13 Displaying the Status of EPLD Upgrades13 Limitations13 Related Documentation13 Release Notes14 Documentation Feedback14 Obtaining Documentation and Submitting a Service Request14   The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images fromhttps://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the following hardware: ■Supervisor modules (2)—each with at least 800 MB of available boot flash memory (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) ■System controller modules (2) (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) ■Line cards (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) —Cisco Nexus 9504 switch (1 to 4 line cards) —Cisco Nexus 9508 switch (1 to 8 line cards) —Cisco Nexus 9516 switch (1 to 16 line cards) ■Fabric modules (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) —Fabric modules for 40-Gigabit line cards on a Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, or 9516 switch (3-6 modules) —Fabric modules for 100-Gigabit –E line cards on a Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, or 9516 switch (4 modules) —Fabric modules for 100-Gigabit –S line cards on a Cisco Nexus 9504 or 9508 switch (4 modules) ■Fan modules —Cisco Nexus 92304QC, 9272Q, and 93120TX switches (2 modules) —Cisco Nexus 9336C-FX2, 9364C, 9396PX, 9396TX, and 93128TX switches (3 modules) —Cisco Nexus 9236C, 92160YC-X, 92300YC, 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372PX-E, 9372TX, 9372TX-E, 93108TC-EX, and 93180LC-EX switches (4 modules) —Cisco Nexus 9332C, and 93240YC-FX2 switch (5 modules) —Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches (3 fan trays) ■Power supplies —500-W AC, 930-W DC, or 1200-W HVAC/HVDC power supplies (2 for the Cisco Nexus 93180LC-EX switches) —650-W AC, 930-W DC, or 1200-W HVAC/HVDC power supplies (2 for the Cisco Nexus 92160YC-X, 92304QC, 9236C, 93108TC-EX, 93180YC-EX, 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372PX-E, 9372TX, 9372TX-E, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches —650-W AC or 1200-W HVAC/HVDC power supplies (2 for Cisco Nexus 92300YC switches) —930-W DC power supplies (2 for all Cisco Nexus 9200 and 9300 platform switches (except 92300YC and 9348GC-FXP switches) —11000W AC power supplies (2) for the Cisco Nexus 9332C, 9336C and 93240YC switches —11000W DC power supplies (2) for the Cisco Nexus 9332C, 9336C and 93240YC switches —11000W HVAC/HVDC power supplies (2) for the Cisco Nexus 9336C and 93240YC switches —1200-W AC power supplies (2) or 930-W DC power supplies (2) for the Cisco Nexus 9272Q, 93120TX, 93128TX, and 9364C switches —1200-W HVAC/HVDC power supplies (2) for all Cisco Nexus 9200 and 9300 platform switches (except the 9348GC-FXP switch) —3000-W AC power supplies or 3000-W Universal AC/DC or 3000-W DC power supplies for Cisco Nexus 9500 switches —3.15-kW dual input universal AC/DC power for the Cisco Nexus 9500 switches - Cisco Nexus 9504 switch (up to 4) - Cisco Nexus 9508 switch (up to 8) - Cisco Nexus 9516 switch (up to 10) ■Uplink module (Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches only) —M4PC-CFP2 —M6PQ —M6PQ-E —M12PQ You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode).

Please do not attempt to upgrade Golden region of FPGA once it is on a fixed version.   1. Copy the EPLD image to bootflash (e.g. used n9000-epld.secure-boot.img). 2. If you have dual supervisor, determine which is the standby Supervisor by doing 'show module' and start upgrading it first. On the N9K, Only supervisors need upgrade for this vulnerability.

Introduction The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. Note: EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images from https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html . When choosing an EPLD version for upgrade, ensure you have already installed the corresponding NXOS software version first. It is generally not supported to upgrade to a newer EPLD image built for a future version of NXOS while running on an older NXOS version, unless explicitly supported as per the specific EPLD Release Notes. NXOS and EPLD images are labeled for their related version to avoid any unsupported upgrades. When to Upgrade EPLDs When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. Note: The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Note: Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. Note: EPLD version is backward compatible. The NXOS software can be downgraded for the switch and the EPLD version does not have to be downgraded to match the older NXOS version. Switch Requirements · The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system. · You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode). · You must have administrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. EPLD Upgrades Available for NX-OS Mode Releases 10.3(1) through 10.4(3) Each EPLD image that you can download from Software Download page is a bundle of EPLD upgrades packaged into a single EPLD image file. To see the available EPLD versions for the Nexus 9000 standalone and module switches on this release, see the tables. Note: All updates to an image are shown in boldface. If more than one release is shown for a column, the boldface applies to the first release listed for the column.

Introduction The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. Note: EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images from https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html . When choosing an EPLD version for upgrade, ensure you have already installed the corresponding NXOS software version first. It is generally not supported to upgrade to a newer EPLD image built for a future version of NXOS while running on an older NXOS version, unless explicitly supported as per the specific EPLD Release Notes. NXOS and EPLD images are labeled for their related version to avoid any unsupported upgrades. When to Upgrade EPLDs When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. Note: The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Plan to execute this operation during a scheduled maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Note: Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. Note: EPLD version is backward compatible. The NXOS software can be downgraded for the switch and the EPLD version does not have to be downgraded to match the older NXOS version. Switch Requirements The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode). You must have administrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch when performing upgrades. EPLD Upgrades Available for NX-OS Mode Releases 10.3(1) through 10.4(2) Each EPLD image that you can download from Software Download page is a bundle of EPLD upgrades packaged into a single EPLD image file. To see the available EPLD versions for the Nexus 9000 standalone and module switches on this release, see the tables. Note: All updates to an image are shown in boldface. If more than one release is shown for a column, the boldface applies to the first release listed for the column.

This document also covers later releases. If a new Cisco Nexus 9000 Series FPGA/EPLD Upgrade Release Notes document isn’t available, that means that these are the latest available numbers for upgrade.

February 4, 2025 Fixed values for N9K-C93180YC-FX3H Introduction The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. Note: EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images from https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html . When choosing an EPLD version for upgrade, ensure you have already installed the corresponding NXOS software version first. It is generally not supported to upgrade to a newer EPLD image built for a future version of NXOS while running on an older NXOS version, unless explicitly supported as per the specific EPLD Release Notes. NXOS and EPLD images are labeled for their related version to avoid any unsupported upgrades. When to Upgrade EPLDs When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. Note: The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Note: Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. EPLD version is backward compatible. The NXOS software can be downgraded for the switch and the EPLD version does not have to be downgraded to match the older NXOS version. Switch Requirements · The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system. · You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode). · You must have administrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. EPLD Upgrades Available for NX-OS Mode Releases 10.3(1) through 10.4(4) Each EPLD image that you can download from Software Download page is a bundle of EPLD upgrades packaged into a single EPLD image file. To see the available EPLD versions for the Nexus 9000 standalone and module switches on this release, see the tables. Note: All updates to an image are shown in boldface. If more than one release is shown for a column, the boldface applies to the first release listed for the column. Note: This release of EPLD addresses the Secure Boot Hardware Tampering vulnerability for Nexus 9000 Series switches.

Introduction The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. Note: EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability. You can download the EPLD images from https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html . When choosing an EPLD version for upgrade, ensure you have already installed the corresponding NXOS software version first. It is generally not supported to upgrade to a newer EPLD image built for a future version of NXOS while running on an older NXOS version, unless explicitly supported as per the specific EPLD Release Notes. NXOS and EPLD images are labeled for their related version to avoid any unsupported upgrades. When to Upgrade EPLDs When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. Note: The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Plan to execute this operation during a scheduled maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Note: Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. Note: The EPLD version is backward compatible. The NXOS software can be downgraded for the switch and the EPLD version does not have to be downgraded to match the older NXOS version. Switch Requirements The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system. You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode). You must have administrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch when performing upgrades. EPLD Upgrades Available for NX-OS Mode Releases 10.2(2) through 10.4(1) Each EPLD image that you can download from Software Download page is a bundle of EPLD upgrades packaged into a single EPLD image file. To see the available EPLD versions for the Nexus 9000 standalone and module switches on this release, see the tables. Note: All updates to an image are shown in boldface. If more than one release is shown for a column, the boldface applies to the first release listed for the column. Note: This release of EPLD addresses the Secure Boot Hardware Tampering vulnerability for Nexus 9000 Series switches.

Introduction The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. Note: EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images from https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html . When choosing an EPLD version for upgrade, ensure you have already installed the corresponding NXOS software version first. It is generally not supported to upgrade to a newer EPLD image built for a future version of NXOS while running on an older NXOS version, unless explicitly supported as per the specific EPLD Release Notes. NXOS and EPLD images are labeled for their related version to avoid any unsupported upgrades. When to Upgrade EPLDs When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. Note: The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Note: Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. Note: EPLD version is backward compatible. The NXOS software can be downgraded for the switch and the EPLD version does not have to be downgraded to match the older NXOS version. Switch Requirements · The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system · You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode). · You must have administrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. EPLD Upgrades Available for NX-OS Mode Releases 10.2(3) through 10.3(4a) Each EPLD image that you can download from Software Download page is a bundle of EPLD upgrades packaged into a single EPLD image file. To see the available EPLD versions for the Nexus 9000 standalone and module switches on this release, see the tables. Note: All updates to an image are shown in boldface. If more than one release is shown for a column, the boldface applies to the first release listed for the column.

This document also covers later releases. If a new Cisco Nexus 9000 Series FPGA/EPLD Upgrade Release Notes document isn’t available, then that means that these are the latest available numbers for upgrade. This table lists the changes to this document. Table 1. Changes to this Document Date Description May 12, 2024 Release 10.3(5) became available. September 6, 2024 Removed an inaccurate PID for a switch. November 9, 2024 Enhanced and moved Secure Boot content to rear of document. Updated command to install epld bootflash:<image-name> module all and install epld bootflash:<image-name> module all golden in Nexus 9000 TOR section. Introduction The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. Note: EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images from https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html . When choosing an EPLD version for upgrade, ensure you have already installed the corresponding NXOS software version first. It is generally not supported to upgrade to a newer EPLD image built for a future version of NXOS while running on an older NXOS version, unless explicitly supported as per the specific EPLD Release Notes. NXOS and EPLD images are labeled for their related version to avoid any unsupported upgrades. When to Upgrade EPLDs When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. Note: The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Note: Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. Note: EPLD version is backwards compatible. The NXOS software can be downgraded for the switch and the EPLD version does not have to be downgraded to match the older NXOS version. Switch Requirements · The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system. · You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode). · You must have administrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. EPLD Upgrades Available for NX-OS Mode Releases 10.2(3) through 10.3(5) Each EPLD image that you can download from Software Download page is a bundle of EPLD upgrades packaged into a single EPLD image file. To see the available EPLD versions for the Nexus 9000 standalone and module switches on this release, see the tables. Note: All updates to an image are shown in boldface. If more than one release is shown for a column, the boldface applies to the first release listed for the column. Note: This release of EPLD addresses the Secure Boot Hardware Tampering vulnerability for Nexus 9000 Series switches.

The following table lists the changes to this document. Table 1. Changes to this Document Date Description May 8, 2023 Release 10.3(3) became available.

Updated command to install epld bootflash:<image-name> module all and install epld bootflash:<image-name> module all golden in Nexus 9000 TOR section. Introduction The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. Note: EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images from https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html . When choosing an EPLD version for upgrade, ensure you have already installed the corresponding NXOS software version first. It is generally not supported to upgrade to a newer EPLD image built for a future version of NXOS while running on an older NXOS version, unless explicitly supported as per the specific EPLD Release Notes. NXOS and EPLD images are labeled for their related version to avoid any unsupported upgrades. When to Upgrade EPLDs When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. Note: The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Note: Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. EPLD version is backward compatible. The NXOS software can be downgraded for the switch and the EPLD version does not have to be downgraded to match the older NXOS version. Switch Requirements · The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system. · You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode). · You must have administrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. EPLD Upgrades Available for NX-OS Mode Releases 10.2(2) through 10.3(3) Each EPLD image that you can download from Software Download page is a bundle of EPLD upgrades packaged into a single EPLD image file. To see the available EPLD versions for the Nexus 9000 standalone and module switches on this release, see the tables. Note: All updates to an image are shown in boldface. If more than one release is shown for a column, the boldface applies to the first release listed for the column. Note: This release of EPLD addresses the Secure Boot Hardware Tampering vulnerability for Nexus 9000 Series switches.

Note: EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images from https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html . When choosing an EPLD version for upgrade, ensure you have already installed the corresponding NXOS software version first. It is generally not supported to upgrade to a newer EPLD image built for a future version of NXOS while running on an older NXOS version, unless explicitly supported as per the specific EPLD Release Notes. NXOS and EPLD images are labeled for their related version to avoid any unsupported upgrades. When to Upgrade EPLDs When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. Note: The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Note: Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. Note: EPLD version is backward compatible. Switch Requirements The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode). You must have administrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. EPLD Upgrades Available for NX-OS Mode Releases 10.2(1) through 10.3(2) Note: Each EPLD image that you can download from Software Download page is a bundle of EPLD upgrades packaged into a single EPLD image file. To see the available EPLD versions for the Nexus 9000 standalone and module switches on this release, see the tables. Note: All updates to an image are shown in boldface. If more than one release is shown for a column, the boldface applies to the first release listed for the column. Note: This release of EPLD addresses the Secure Boot Hardware Tampering vulnerability for Nexus 9000 Series switches.

Introduction The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. Note: EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified.

        "content": "This document lists the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. This document also covers later releases. If a new Cisco Nexus 9000 Series FPGA/EPLD Upgrade Release Notes document isn’t available, then that means that these are the latest available numbers for upgrade. The table lists the changes to this document. Table 1. Changes to this Document Date Description June 28, 2024 Release 10.2(8) became available. No changes from the 10.2(7) release. November 9, 2024 Enhanced and moved Secure Boot content to rear of document. Updated command to install epld bootflash:<image-name> module all and install epld bootflash:<image-name> module all golden in Nexus 9000 TOR section. Introduction The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS-mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. Note: EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images from Software Download Navigator . When choosing an EPLD version for upgrade, ensure you have already installed the corresponding NXOS software version first. It is generally not supported to upgrade to a newer EPLD image built for a future version of NXOS while running on an older NXOS version, unless explicitly supported as per the specific EPLD Release Notes. NXOS and EPLD images are labeled for their related version to avoid any unsupported upgrades. When to Upgrade EPLDs When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. Note: The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Note: Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. Note: EPLD version is backward compatible. The NXOS software can be downgraded for the switch and the EPLD version does not have to be downgraded to match the older NXOS version. Switch Requirements · The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system · You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode). · You must have administrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. EPLD Upgrades Available for NX-OS Mode Releases 10.2(2) through 10.2(8) Each EPLD image that you can download from Software Download page is a bundle of EPLD upgrades packaged into a single EPLD image file. To see the available EPLD versions for the Nexus 9000 standalone and module switches on this release, see the tables. Note: All updates to an image are shown in boldface. If more than one release is shown for a column, the boldface applies to the first release listed for the column. Note: This release of EPLD addresses the Secure Boot Hardware Tampering vulnerability for Nexus 9000 Series switches.

        "title": "Cisco Nexus 9000 Series FPGA/EPLD Upgrade Release Notes, Release 10.2(6) - Cisco",
        "content": "This document lists the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. This document also covers later releases. If a new Cisco Nexus 9000 Series FPGA/EPLD Upgrade Release Notes document isn’t available, then that means that these are the latest available numbers for upgrade. The following table lists the changes to this document. Table 1. Changes to this Document Date Description September 1, 2023 Release 10.2(6) became available. Introduction The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. Note: EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images from https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html . When to Upgrade EPLDs When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. Note: The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Note: Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. Note: EPLD version is backward compatible. Switch Requirements The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode). You must have administrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. EPLD Upgrades Available for NX-OS Mode Releases 10.2(2) through 10.2(6) Each EPLD image that you can download from Software Download page, is a bundle of EPLD upgrades. To see the recent updated EPLD versions for the Cisco Nexus 9200, 9300, 9300-EX, 9300-FX, and 9500 platforms, see the following tables. Note: All updates to an image are shown in boldface. If more than one release is shown for a column, the boldface applies to the first release listed for the column. Note: The 10.2(6) release of EPLD, addresses the Secure Boot Hardware Tampering vulnerability for the Nexus 3K and Nexus 9000 Series switches. Please refer to Security Advisory. Please review the advisory for affected HW-PIDs (see below table) for more details on how to apply the patch. The 10.2(2) release epld requires a specific sequence of upgrade.

It is by design, that we don't allow updating both primary and golden at the same time (to avoid programming errors, that may cause switch to not boot, hence only one region is allowed to be programmed per reload). Please do not attempt to upgrade Golden region of FPGA once it is on a fixed version. 1. Copy the EPLD image to bootflash (e.g. used n9000-epld.10.2.6.img). 2. If you have dual supervisor, determine which is the standby Supervisor by doing 'show module' and start upgrading it first. On the N9K, Only supervisors need upgrade for this vulnerability. LC/FM/SC cards are not affected. 3. Assuming standby supervisor is slot 28. Update the Primary FPGA region of standby supervisor. install epld bootflash:n9000-epld.10.2.6.img module 28 Expected result: Switch will update primary EPLD of standby supervisor and will reload the standby supervisor module automatically. Please don't interrupt, power cycle or reload when EPLD update is happening. Once standby is booted, it will again come up as standby supervisor.  A 'show version module 28 epld' will continue to show old version. switch# show mod | grep SUP 27   0    Supervisor Module                     N9K-SUP-A             active * 28   0    Supervisor Module                     N9K-SUP-A             ha-standby 27   9.3(0.416)               1.0    SUP1 28   9.3(0.416)               0.3011 SUP2 switch# show version module 28 epld EPLD Device                     Version --------------------------------------- IO FPGA                          0x27 This is expected, as the switch would have booted from Golden FPGA which is still not updated. You can verify this from syslog which would say: %CARDCLIENT-5-MOD_BOOT_GOLDEN: Module 28 IOFPGA booted from Golden 4. Update the Golden (also called backup) FPGA region of the standby supervisor. install epld bootflash:n9000-epld.10.2.6.img module 28 golden Module 28 : IO FPGA [Programming      ] : 100.00% (     64 of      64 total sectors) Module 28 EPLD upgrade is successful.

Please don't interrupt, power cycle or reload when EPLD update is happening. Once standby is booted, it will again come up as ha-standby supervisor. Once this is done, when you check 'show version module 28 epld' you will see FPGA version that is >= to the fixed version for the standby supervisor.  Your switch has the fixed version for standby supervisor. switch# show version module 28 epld EPLD Device                     Version --------------------------------------- IO FPGA                          0x30 Repeat Step 3 and  4, for the active supervisor. At the end of Step 3, supervisor in slot 27 will reload and hence now will be-come standby supervisor. The active supervisor will be Supervisor in slot 28. (considering SUP 27 is active to begin with, for the above activity, such as steps 3 and 4, commands would have 27 in place of 28.)

When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images from Software Download Navigator . When choosing an EPLD version for upgrade, ensure you have already installed the corresponding NXOS software version first. It is generally not supported to upgrade to a newer EPLD image built for a future version of NXOS while running on an older NXOS version, unless explicitly supported as per the specific EPLD Release Notes. NXOS and EPLD images are labeled for their related version to avoid any unsupported upgrades. When to Upgrade EPLDs When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. Note: The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Note: Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. Note: EPLD version is backward compatible. The NXOS software can be downgraded for the switch and the EPLD version does not have to be downgraded to match the older NXOS version. Switch Requirements · The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system · You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode). · You must have administrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. EPLD Upgrades Available for NX-OS Mode Releases 10.2(2) through 10.2(7) Each EPLD image that you can download from Software Download page is a bundle of EPLD upgrades packaged into a single EPLD image file.

The table lists the changes to this document. Table 1. Changes to this Document Date Description October 27, 2022 Release 10.2(4) became available. August 22, 2024 Fixed PIDs with extra spaces Introduction The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. Note: EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images from https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html . When to Upgrade EPLDs When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. Note: The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Note: Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. Note: EPLD version is backward compatible. Switch Requirements The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode). You must have administrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. EPLD Upgrades Available for NX-OS Mode Releases 10.1(2) through 10.2(4) Each EPLD image that you can download from Software Download page, is a bundle of EPLD upgrades. To see the recent updated EPLD versions for the Cisco Nexus 9200, 9300, 9300-EX, 9300-FX, and 9500 platforms, see the tables. Note: All updates to an image are shown in boldface. If more than one release is shown for a column, the boldface applies to the first release listed for the column. Note: The 10.2(4) release of EPLD, addresses the Secure Boot Hardware Tampering vulnerability for the Nexus 3K and Nexus 9000 Series switches. Please refer to Security Advisory. Please review the advisory for affected HW-PIDs (see table) for more details on how to apply the patch. The 10.2(1) release EPLD requires a specific sequence of upgrade.

It is by design, that we don't allow updating both primary and golden at the same time (to avoid programming errors, that may cause switch to not boot, hence only one region is allowed to be programmed per reload). Please do not attempt to upgrade Golden region of FPGA once it is on a fixed version. 1. Copy the EPLD image to bootflash (e.g. used n9000-epld.10.2.4.img). 2. If you have dual supervisor, determine which is the standby Supervisor by doing 'show module' and start upgrading it first. On the N9K, Only supervisors need upgrade for this vulnerability. LC/FM/SC cards are not affected. 3. Assuming standby supervisor is slot 28. Update the Primary FPGA region of standby supervisor. install epld bootflash:n9000-epld.10.2.4.img module 28 Expected result: Switch will update primary EPLD of standby supervisor and will reload the standby supervisor module automatically. Please don't interrupt, power cycle or reload when EPLD update is happening. Once standby is booted, it will again come up as standby supervisor.  A 'show version module 28 epld' will continue to show old version. switch# show mod | grep SUP 27   0    Supervisor Module                     N9K-SUP-A             active * 28   0    Supervisor Module                     N9K-SUP-A             ha-standby 27   9.3(0.416)               1.0    SUP1 28   9.3(0.416)               0.3011 SUP2 switch# show version module 28 epld EPLD Device                     Version --------------------------------------- IO FPGA                          0x27 This is expected, as the switch would have booted from Golden FPGA which is still not updated.

        "title": "Cisco Nexus 9000 Series FPGA/EPLD Upgrade Release Notes, Release 10.2(5) - Cisco",
        "content": "This document lists the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. This document also covers later releases. If a new Cisco Nexus 9000 Series FPGA/EPLD Upgrade Release Notes document isn’t available, then that means that these are the latest available numbers for upgrade. The following table lists the changes to this document. Table 1. Changes to this Document Date Description March 7, 2023 Release 10.2(5) became available. Introduction The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. Note: EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images from https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html . When to Upgrade EPLDs When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. Note: The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Note: Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. Note: EPLD version is backward compatible. Switch Requirements The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode). You must have administrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. EPLD Upgrades Available for NX-OS Mode Releases 10.2(1) through 10.2(5) Each EPLD image that you can download from Software Download page, is a bundle of EPLD upgrades. To see the recent updated EPLD versions for the Cisco Nexus 9200, 9300, 9300-EX, 9300-FX, and 9500 platforms, see the following tables. Note: All updates to an image are shown in boldface. If more than one release is shown for a column, the boldface applies to the first release listed for the column. Note: The 10.2(5) release of EPLD, addresses the Secure Boot Hardware Tampering vulnerability for the Nexus 3K and Nexus 9000 Series switches. Please refer to Security Advisory. Please review the advisory for affected HW-PIDs (see below table) for more details on how to apply the patch. The 10.2(1)) release epld requires a specific sequence of upgrade.

        "content": "This document lists the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. This document also covers later releases. If a new Cisco Nexus 9000 Series FPGA/EPLD Upgrade Release Notes document isn’t available, then that means that these are the latest available numbers for upgrade. The following table lists the changes to this document. Table 1. Changes to this Document Date Description May 14, 2021 Rele ase 10.1(2) became available. Introduction The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. Note: EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images from https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html . When to Upgrade EPLDs When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. Note: The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Note: Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. Note: EPLD version is backward compatible. Switch Requirements The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode). You must have administrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. EPLD Upgrades Available for NX-OS Mode Releases 9.3(5) through 10.1(2) Each EPLD image that you can download from Software Download page, is a bundle of EPLD upgrades. To see the recent updated EPLD versions for the Cisco Nexus 9200, 9300, 9300-EX, 9300-FX, and 9500 platforms, see the following tables. Note: All updates to an image are shown in boldface. If more than one release is shown for a column, the boldface applies to the first release listed for the column. Note: The 10.1(2) release of EPLD, addresses the Secure Boot Hardware Tampering vulnerability for the Nexus 3K and Nexus 9000 Series switches. Please refer to Security Advisory. Please review the advisory for affected HW-PIDs (see below table) for more details on how to apply the patch. The 10.1(2)) release epld requires a specific sequence of upgrade.

When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images from https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html . When choosing an EPLD version for upgrade, ensure you have already installed the corresponding NXOS software version first. It is generally not supported to upgrade to a newer EPLD image built for a future version of NXOS while running on an older NXOS version, unless explicitly supported as per the specific EPLD Release Notes. NXOS and EPLD images are labeled for their related version to avoid any unsupported upgrades. When to Upgrade EPLDs When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. Note: The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Note: Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. Note: EPLD version is backward compatible. The NXOS software can be downgraded for the switch and the EPLD version does not have to be downgraded to match the older NXOS version. Switch Requirements · The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system. · You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode). · You must have administrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch.

It is by design that we don't allow updating both primary and golden at the same time (to avoid programming errors, that may cause switch to not boot, so only one region is allowed to be programmed per reload). Please do not attempt to upgrade Golden region of FPGA once it is on a fixed version. 1. Copy the EPLD image to bootflash (e.g., used n9000-epld.9.3.14.img). 2. If you have dual supervisor, determine which is the standby Supervisor by doing 'show module' and start upgrading it first. On the N9K, only supervisors need upgrade for this vulnerability. LC/FM/SC cards are not affected. 3. Assuming standby supervisor is slot 28, update the Primary FPGA region of standby supervisor. install epld bootflash:n9000-epld.9.3.14.img module 28 Expected result: Switch will update primary EPLD of standby supervisor and will reload the standby supervisor module automatically.

Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. Note:EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images fromhttps://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. Note:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Note:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. Note:EPLD version is backward compatible. The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode).

Cisco Nexus 9000 Series FPGA/EPLD Upgrade Release Notes, Release9.3(8), 9.3(9), 9.3(10)  This document lists the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. This document also covers later releases. If a newer Cisco Nexus 9000 Series FPGA/EPLD Upgrade Release Notes document isn’t available, then these are the latest numbers available for upgrade. The following table lists the changes to this document. Date Description August 6, 2021 Release 9.3(8) became available.  ■Introduction ■When to Upgrade EPLDs ■Switch Requirements ■EPLD Upgrades Available for NX-OS Mode Releases 9.3(5) through 9.3(8-10) ■Cisco Secure Boot Hardware Tampering Vulnerability - Remediation Steps ■Determining Whether to Upgrade EPLD Images ■Downloading the EPLD Images ■Installation Guidelines ■Upgrading the EPLD Images ■Verifying the EPLD Upgrades ■Displaying the Status of EPLD Upgrades ■Limitations ■Related Documentation ■Legal Information  The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images fromhttps://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. NOTE:EPLD version is backward compatible. The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode). You must have administrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. Each EPLD image that you can download fromSoftware Download page, is a bundle of EPLD upgrades. To see the recent updated EPLD versions for the Cisco Nexus 9200, 9300, 9300-EX, 9300-FX, and9500platforms, see the following tables. NOTE:All updates to an image are shown in boldface. If more than one release is shown for a column, the boldface applies to the first release listed for the column. NOTE:The 9.3(8) release of EPLD, addresses the Secure Boot Hardware Tampering vulnerability for the Nexus 3K and Nexus 9000 Series switches. Please refer toSecurity Advisory.  Please review the advisory for affected HW-PIDs (see below table) for more details on how to apply the patch. The 9.3(8) release epld requires a specific sequence of upgrade.

Please do not attempt to upgrade Golden region of FPGA once it is on a fixed version.  1. Copy the EPLD image to bootflash (e.g. used n9000-epld.9.3.8.img). 2. If you have dual supervisor, determine which is the standby Supervisor by doing 'show module' and start upgrading it first. On the N9K, Only supervisors need upgrade for this vulnerability. LC/FM/SC cards are not affected. 3. Assuming standby supervisor is slot 28. Update the Primary FPGA region of standby supervisor.  install epld bootflash:n9000-epld.9.3.8.img module 28  Expected result: Switch will update primary EPLD of standby supervisor and will reload the standby supervisor module automatically.

Cisco Nexus 9000 Series FPGA/EPLD Upgrade Release Notes, Release 9.3(3)  This document lists the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. The following table lists the changes to this document. Date Description December 23, 2019 Release 9.3(3) became available.  ■Introduction ■When to Upgrade EPLDs ■Switch Requirements ■EPLD Upgrades Available for NX-OS Mode Releases 9.2(3) through 9.3(3) ■Cisco Secure Boot Hardware Tampering Vulnerability - Remediation Steps ■Determining Whether to Upgrade EPLD Images ■Downloading the EPLD Images ■Installation Guidelines ■Limitations ■Related Content ■Documentation Feedback ■Legal Information  The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images fromhttps://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. NOTE:EPLD version is backward compatible. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the following hardware: ■Supervisor modules (2)—each with at least 800 MB of available boot flash memory (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) ■System controller modules (2) (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) ■Line cards (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) —Cisco Nexus 9504 switch (1 to 4 line cards) —Cisco Nexus 9508 switch (1 to 8 line cards) —Cisco Nexus 9516 switch (1 to 16 line cards) ■Fabric modules (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) —Fabric modules for 40-Gigabit line cards on a Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, or 9516 switch (3-6 modules) —Fabric modules for 100-Gigabit –E line cards on a Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, or 9516 switch (4 modules) —Fabric modules for 100-Gigabit –S line cards on a Cisco Nexus 9504 or 9508 switch (4 modules) ■Fan modules —Cisco Nexus 92304QC, 9272Q, and 93120TX switches (2 modules) —Cisco Nexus 9336C-FX2, 9364C, 9396PX, 9396TX, and 93128TX switches (3 modules) —Cisco Nexus 9236C, 92160YC-X, 92300YC, 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372PX-E, 9372TX, 9372TX-E, 93108TC-EX, and 93180LC-EX switches (4 modules) —Cisco Nexus 9332C, and 93240YC-FX2 switch (5 modules) —Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches (3 fan trays) ■Power supplies —500-W AC, 930-W DC, or 1200-W HVAC/HVDC power supplies (2 for the Cisco Nexus 93180LC-EX switches) —650-W AC, 930-W DC, or 1200-W HVAC/HVDC power supplies (2 for the Cisco Nexus 92160YC-X, 92304QC, 9236C, 93108TC-EX, 93180YC-EX, 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372PX-E, 9372TX, 9372TX-E, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches —650-W AC or 1200-W HVAC/HVDC power supplies (2 for Cisco Nexus 92300YC switches) —930-W DC power supplies (2 for all Cisco Nexus 9200 and 9300 platform switches (except 92300YC and 9348GC-FXP switches) —11000W AC power supplies (2) for the Cisco Nexus 9332C, 9336C and 93240YC switches —11000W DC power supplies (2) for the Cisco Nexus 9332C, 9336C and 93240YC switches —11000W HVAC/HVDC power supplies (2) for the Cisco Nexus 9336C and 93240YC switches —1200-W AC power supplies (2) or 930-W DC power supplies (2) for the Cisco Nexus 9272Q, 93120TX, 93128TX, and 9364C switches —1200-W HVAC/HVDC power supplies (2) for all Cisco Nexus 9200 and 9300 platform switches (except the 9348GC-FXP switch) —3000-W AC power supplies or 3000-W Universal AC/DC or 3000-W DC power supplies for Cisco Nexus 9500 switches —3.15-kW dual input universal AC/DC power for the Cisco Nexus 9500 switches - Cisco Nexus 9504 switch (up to 4) - Cisco Nexus 9508 switch (up to 8) - Cisco Nexus 9516 switch (up to 10) ■Uplink module (Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches only) —M4PC-CFP2 —M6PQ —M6PQ-E —M12PQ You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode).

Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images fromhttps://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. NOTE:EPLD version is backward compatible. The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode). You must have administrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. Each EPLD image that you can download fromhttps://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.htmlis a bundle of EPLD upgrades. To see the recent updated EPLD versions for the Cisco Nexus 9200, 9300, 9300-EX, 9300-FX, and9500platforms, see the following tables. NOTE:All updates to an image are shown in boldface. If more than one release is shown for a column, the boldface applies to the first release listed for the column.  NOTE:The 9.3(4) release of EPLD, addresses the Secure Boot Hardware Tampering vulnerability for the Nexus 3K and Nexus 9000 Series switches.

Please do not attempt to upgrade Golden region of FPGA once it is on a fixed version.  1. Copy the EPLD image to bootflash (e.g. used n9000-epld.9.3.4.img). 2. If you have dual supervisor, determine which is the standby Supervisor by doing 'show module' and start upgrading it first. On the N9K, Only supervisors need upgrade for this vulnerability. LC/FM/SC cards are not affected. 3. Assuming standby supervisor is slot 28. Update the Primary FPGA region of standby supervisor.  install epld bootflash:n9000-epld.9.3.4.img module 28  Expected result: Switch will update primary EPLD of standby supervisor and will reload the standby supervisor module automatically. Please don't interrupt, power cycle or reload when EPLD update is happening. Once standby is booted, it will again come up as standby supervisor.  A 'show version module 28 epld' will continue to show old version.  switch# show mod | grep SUP 27   0    Supervisor Module                     N9K-SUP-A             active * 28   0    Supervisor Module                     N9K-SUP-A             ha-standby 27   9.3(0.416)               1.0    SUP1 28   9.3(0.416)               0.3011 SUP2  switch# show version module 28 epld EPLD Device                     Version --------------------------------------- IO FPGA                          0x27  This is expected, as the switch would have booted from Golden FPGA which is still not updated.

The following section details updating your EPLD version for affected switches listed in:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190513-secureboot Nexus 9000 Modular chassis with dual supervisor:  IMPORTANT NOTE:It is required to update both Golden and Primary regions of FPGA to address this particular vulnerability.It is by design, that we don't allow updating both primary and golden at the same time (to avoid programming errors, that may cause switch to not boot, hence only one region is allowed to be programmed per reload).  Please do not attempt to upgrade Golden region of FPGA once it is on a fixed version.  1. Copy the EPLD image to bootflash (e.g. used n9000-epld.9.3.1.img). 2. If you have dual supervisor, determine which is the standby Supervisor by doing 'show module' and start upgrading it first. On the N9K, Only supervisors need upgrade for this vulnerability. LC/FM/SC cards are not affected. 3. Assuming standby supervisor is slot 28. Update the Primary FPGA region of standby supervisor.  install epld bootflash:n9000-epld.9.3.1.img module 28  Expected result: Switch will update primary EPLD of standby supervisor and will reload the standby supervisor module automatically. Please don't interrupt, power cycle or reload when EPLD update is happening. Once standby is booted, it will again come up as standby supervisor.  A 'show version module 28 epld' will continue to show old version.  switch# show mod | grep SUP 27   0    Supervisor Module                     N9K-SUP-A             active * 28   0    Supervisor Module                     N9K-SUP-A             ha-standby 27   9.3(0...",

Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. NOTE:For N9K-C9348GC-FXP, EPLD should be upgraded to minimum 9.2(3) version for 9.2(x) release. Please refer toCSCvm94301for further details. NOTE:N9300-EX/N9300-FX/N9200 switches running 703I7(2-5), 9.2(1), or 9.2(2) version of the code, may experience constant high PTP correction (~125/250ms) with no change from the grand master clock. Please refer toCSCvn94487for further details. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images fromhttps://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. NOTE:EPLD version is backward compatible. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade.

Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at this time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart upgrade. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade will cause the 3600 ToR switch to reload.

To determine which devices need upgraded EPLDs, use theshow install impact epld bootflash:command for a device and indicate the latest EPLD image file (n9000-epld.7.0.3.f3.3.img). The output for this command indicates the current EPLD images, new EPLD images, and whether the upgrades would be disruptive to switch operations. If the currently installed EPLD version number is greater than the new EPLD image number, you can skip the upgrade. ■To determine the EPLD upgrades needed for a Cisco Nexus 9500 platform modular switch, use theshow install impact epld bootflash:command on thatswitch and indicate the n9000-epld.7.0.3.f3.3 image. In the following example, the MIFPGA and IOFPGA EPLD images can be upgraded for the line cards in slots 2 through 7 and all of the fabric modules. These upgrades are disruptive.

Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images fromhttps://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade.NOTE:EPLD version is backward compatible. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade.

Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at this time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 36180YC-R switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the following hardware: ■Fan modules (2) —NXA-FAN-65CFM-B (port-side intake airflow) —NXA-FAN-65CFM-F (port-side exhaust airflow) ■Power supplies (1 plus 1 for redundancy) —NXA-PAC-1100W-PE2 (port-side exhaust airflow) —NXA-PAC-1100W-PI2 (port-side intake airflow) —NXA-PHV-1100W-PE (port-side exhaust airflow) —NXA-PHV-1100W-PI (port-side intake airflow) —NXA-PDC-1100W-PE (port-side exhaust airflow) —NXA-PDC-1100W-PI (port-side intake airflow) The Cisco Nexus 9508 switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the following hardware: ■Supervisor B modules (2)—each with at least 800 MB of available bootflash memory (Cisco Nexus 9508 switches) ■System controller modules (2) ■Line cards (1-8) —N9K-X9636C-R 36-port 100-Gigabit Ethernet QSFP28 line card —N9K-X9636C-RX 36-port 100-Gigabit Ethernet QSFP28 line card —N9K-X9636Q-R 36-port 40-Gigabit Ethernet QSFP+ line card ■Fabric modules —Fabric modules for 100-Gigabit –R line cards on a Cisco Nexus 9508 switch §Maximum of 5 (plus 1 for redundancy) for N9K-X9636C-R and N9K-X9636Q-R line cards §Maximum of 6 for N9K-X9636C-RX line cards ■Fan modules(3) ■Power supplies (up to 8) —3000-W AC power supplies or 3000-W Universal AC/DC or 3000-W DC power supplies You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode but not required for a switch running in ACI-mode).

Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at this time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 36180YC-R switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the following hardware: ·Fan modules (2) oNXA-FAN-65CFM-B (port-side intake airflow) oNXA-FAN-65CFM-F (port-side exhaust airflow) ·Power supplies (1 plus 1 for redundancy) oNXA-PAC-1100W-PE2 (port-side exhaust airflow) oNXA-PAC-1100W-PI2 (port-side intake airflow) oNXA-PHV-1100W-PE (port-side exhaust airflow) oNXA-PHV-1100W-PI (port-side intake airflow) oNXA-PDC-1100W-PE (port-side exhaust airflow) oNXA-PDC-1100W-PI (port-side intake airflow) The Cisco Nexus 9508 switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the following hardware: ·Supervisor B modules (2)—each with at least 800 MB of available bootflash memory (Cisco Nexus 9508 switches) ·System controller modules (2) ·Line cards (1-8) oN9K-X9636C-R 36-port 100-Gigabit Ethernet QSFP28 line card oN9K-X9636C-RX 36-port 100-Gigabit Ethernet QSFP28 line card oN9K-X9636Q-R 36-port 40-Gigabit Ethernet QSFP+ line card ·Fabric modules oFabric modules for 100-Gigabit –R line cards on a Cisco Nexus 9508 switch §Maximum of 5 (plus 1 for redundancy) for N9K-X9636C-R and N9K-X9636Q-R line cards §Maximum of 6 for N9K-X9636C-RX line cards ·Fan modules(3) ·Power supplies (up to 8) o3000-W AC power supplies or 3000-W Universal AC/DC or 3000-W DC power supplies You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode but not required for a switch running in ACI-mode).

Cisco Nexus 9000 Series FPGA/EPLD Upgrade Release Notes, Release 7.0(3)I7(9)  This document lists the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. The following table lists the changes to this document. Date Description August 31, 2020 Release 7.0(3)I7(9) became available.

Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images fromhttps://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade.NOTE:EPLD version is backward compatible. NOTE:If the NXOS image supports the digital signature feature and the EPLD image is not signed digitally, then the user needs to configure “no feature signature-verification”, for the EPLD process to proceed. The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the following hardware: ■Supervisor modules (2)—each with at least 800 MB of available bootflash memory (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) ■System controller modules (2) (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) ■Line cards (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) —Cisco Nexus 9504 switch (1 to 4 line cards) —Cisco Nexus 9508 switch (1 to 8 line cards) —Cisco Nexus 9516 switch (1 to 16 line cards) ■Fabric modules (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) —Fabric modules for 40-Gigabit line cards on a Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, or 9516 switch (3-6 modules) —Fabric modules for 100-Gigabit –E line cards on a Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, or 9516 switch (4 modules) —Fabric modules for 100-Gigabit –S line cards on a Cisco Nexus 9504 or 9508 switch (4 modules) ■Fan modules —Cisco Nexus 92304QC, 9272Q, and 93120TX switches (2 modules) —Cisco Nexus 9336C-FX2, 9364C, 9396PX, 9396TX, and 93128TX switches (3 modules) —Cisco Nexus 9236C, 92160YC-X, 92300YC, 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372PX-E, 9372TX, 9372TX-E, 93108TC-EX, 93180LC-EX, and 92300YC switches (4 modules) —Cisco Nexus 93240YC-FX2 switch (5 modules) —Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches (3 fan trays) ■Power supplies —500-W AC, 930-W DC, or 1200-W HVAC/HVDC power supplies (2 for the Cisco Nexus 93180LC-EX switches) —650-W AC, 930-W DC, or 1200-W HVAC/HVDC power supplies (2 for the Cisco Nexus 92160YC-X, 92304QC, 9236C, 93108TC-EX, 93180YC-EX, 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372PX-E, 9372TX, 9372TX-E, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches —650-W AC or 1200-W HVAC/HVDC power supplies (2 for Cisco Nexus 92300YC switches) —930-W DC power supplies (2 for all Cisco Nexus 9200 and 9300 platform switches (except 92300YC and 9348GC-FXP switches) —11000W AC power supplies (2) for the Cisco Nexus 9336C and 93240YC switches —11000W DC power supplies (2) for the Cisco Nexus 9336C and 93240YC switches —11000W HVAC/HVDC power supplies (2) for the Cisco Nexus 9336C and 93240YC switches —1200-W AC power supplies (2) or 930-W DC power supplies (2) for the Cisco Nexus 9272Q, 93120TX, 93128TX, and 9364C switches —1200-W HVAC/HVDC power supplies (2) for all Cisco Nexus 9200 and 9300 platform switches (except the 9348GC-FXP switch) —3000-W AC power supplies or 3000-W Universal AC/DC or 3000-W DC power supplies for Cisco Nexus 9500 switches - Cisco Nexus 9504 switch (up to 4) - Cisco Nexus 9508 switch (up to 8) - Cisco Nexus 9516 switch (up to 10) ■Uplink module (Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches only) —M4PC-CFP2 —M6PQ —M6PQ-E —M12PQ You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode).

Please follow thislinkfor N9K-C93180LC-EX The following section details updating your EPLD version for affected switches listed in:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190513-secureboot Nexus 9000 Modular chassis with dual supervisor:  IMPORTANT NOTE:It is required to update both Golden and Primary regions of FPGA to address this particular vulnerability.It is by design, that we don't allow updating both primary and golden at the same time (to avoid programming errors, that may cause switch to not boot, hence only one region is allowed to be programmed per reload).  Please do not attempt to upgrade Golden region of FPGA once it is on a fixed version.  1. Copy the EPLD image to bootflash (e.g. used n9000-epld.7.0.3.I7.9.img). 2. If you have dual supervisor, determine which is the standby Supervisor by doing 'show module' and start upgrading it first. On the N9K, Only supervisors need upgrade for this vulnerability. LC/FM/SC cards are not affected. 3. Assuming standby supervisor is slot 28. Update the Primary FPGA region of standby supervisor.  install epld bootflash:n9000-epld.7.0.3.I7.9.img module 28  Expected result: Switch will update primary EPLD of standby supervisor and will reload the standby supervisor module automatically. Please don't interrupt, power cycle or reload when EPLD update is happening. Once standby is booted, it will again come up as standby supervisor.  A 'show version module 28 epld' will continue to show old version.  switch# show mod | grep SUP 27   0    Supervisor...",

To determine which devices need upgraded EPLDs, use theshow install impact epld bootflash:command for a device and indicate the latest EPLD image file (n9000-epld.7.0.3.f1.1.img). The output for this command indicates the current EPLD images, new EPLD images, and whether the upgrades would be disruptive to switch operations. If the currently installed EPLD version number is greater than the new EPLD image number, you can skip the upgrade. ·To determine the EPLD upgrades needed for a Cisco Nexus 3000 switch, use theshow install impact epld bootflash:command on thatswitch and indicate the n9000-epld.7.0.3.f1.1 image. In the following example, the MIFPGA and IOFPGA EPLD images do not need to be upgraded.  ·To determine the EPLD upgrades needed for a Cisco Nexus 92000 or 93000 switch, use theshow install impact epld bootflash:command on thatswitch and indicate the n9000-epld.7.0.3.f1.1 image. In the following example, the MIFPGA and IOFPGA EPLD images can be upgraded for the switch supervisor (slot 1) and the MIFPGA2 EPLD image can be upgraded for the supervisor in the uplink module (slot 2). Both upgrades are disruptive. ·To determine the EPLD upgrades needed for a Cisco Nexus 9500 modular switch, use theshow install impact epld bootflash:command on thatswitch and indicate the n9000-epld.7.0.3.f1.1 image. In the following example, the MIFPGA and IOFPGA EPLD images can be upgraded for the line cards in slots 2 through 7 and all of the fabric modules. These upgrades are disruptive.

Please do not attempt to upgrade Golden region of FPGA once it is on a fixed version.  1. Copy the EPLD image to bootflash (e.g. used n9000-epld.7.0.3.I7.8.img). 2. If you have dual supervisor, determine which is the standby Supervisor by doing 'show module' and start upgrading it first. On the N9K, Only supervisors need upgrade for this vulnerability. LC/FM/SC cards are not affected. 3. Assuming standby supervisor is slot 28. Update the Primary FPGA region of standby supervisor.  install epld bootflash:n9000-epld.7.0.3.I7.8.img module 28  Expected result: Switch will update primary EPLD of standby supervisor and will reload the standby supervisor module automatically. Please don't interrupt, power cycle or reload when EPLD update is happening.

Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images fromhttps://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. NOTE:If the NXOS image supports the digital signature feature and the EPLD image is not signed digitally, then the user needs to configure “no feature signature-verification”, for the EPLD process to proceed.

Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images fromhttps://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. NOTE:If the NXOS image supports the digital signature feature and the EPLD image is not signed digitally, then the user needs to configure “no feature signature-verification”, for the EPLD process to proceed.

Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. NOTE:For N9K-C9348GC-FXP, EPLD should be upgraded to minimum 7.0(3)I7(5a) version. Please refrer toCSCvm94301for further details. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images fromhttps://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. NOTE:If the NXOS image supports the digital signature feature and the EPLD image is not signed digitally, then the user needs to configure “no feature signature-verification”, for the EPLD process to proceed. The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the following hardware: ■Supervisor modules (2)—each with at least 800 MB of available bootflash memory (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) ■System controller modules (2) (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) ■Line cards (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) —Cisco Nexus 9504 switch (1 to 4 line cards) —Cisco Nexus 9508 switch (1 to 8 line cards) —Cisco Nexus 9516 switch (1 to 16 line cards) ■Fabric modules (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) —Fabric modules for 40-Gigabit line cards on a Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, or 9516 switch (3-6 modules) —Fabric modules for 100-Gigabit –E line cards on a Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, or 9516 switch (4 modules) —Fabric modules for 100-Gigabit –S line cards on a Cisco Nexus 9504 or 9508 switch (4 modules) ■Fan modules —Cisco Nexus 92304QC, 9272Q, and 93120TX switches (2 modules) —Cisco Nexus 9336C-FX2, 9364C, 9396PX, 9396TX, and 93128TX switches (3 modules) —Cisco Nexus 9236C, 92160YC-X, 92300YC, 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372PX-E, 9372TX, 9372TX-E, 93108TC-EX, 93180LC-EX, and 92300YC switches (4 modules) —Cisco Nexus 93240YC-FX2 switch (5 modules) —Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches (3 fan trays) ■Power supplies —500-W AC, 930-W DC, or 1200-W HVAC/HVDC power supplies (2 for the Cisco Nexus 93180LC-EX switches) —650-W AC, 930-W DC, or 1200-W HVAC/HVDC power supplies (2 for the Cisco Nexus 92160YC-X, 92304QC, 9236C, 93108TC-EX, 93180YC-EX, 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372PX-E, 9372TX, 9372TX-E, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches —650-W AC or 1200-W HVAC/HVDC power supplies (2 for Cisco Nexus 92300YC switches) —930-W DC power supplies (2 for all Cisco Nexus 9200 and 9300 platform switches (except 92300YC and 9348GC-FXP switches) —11000W AC power supplies (2) for the Cisco Nexus 9336C and 93240YC switches —11000W DC power supplies (2) for the Cisco Nexus 9336C and 93240YC switches —11000W HVAC/HVDC power supplies (2) for the Cisco Nexus 9336C and 93240YC switches —1200-W AC power supplies (2) or 930-W DC power supplies (2) for the Cisco Nexus 9272Q, 93120TX, 93128TX, and 9364C switches —1200-W HVAC/HVDC power supplies (2) for all Cisco Nexus 9200 and 9300 platform switches (except the 9348GC-FXP switch) —3000-W AC power supplies or 3000-W Universal AC/DC or 3000-W DC power supplies for Cisco Nexus 9500 switches - Cisco Nexus 9504 switch (up to 4) - Cisco Nexus 9508 switch (up to 8) - Cisco Nexus 9516 switch (up to 10) ■Uplink module (Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches only) —M4PC-CFP2 —M6PQ —M6PQ-E —M12PQ You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode).

Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images fromhttps://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at this time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade.

Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images fromhttps://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at this time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade.

Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at this time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the following hardware: ·Supervisor modules (2)—each with at least 800 MB of available bootflash memory (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) ·System controller modules (2) (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) ·Line cards (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) oCisco Nexus 9504 switch (1-4) oCisco Nexus 9508 switch (1-8) oCisco Nexus 9516 switch (1-16) ·Fabric modules (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) oFabric modules for 40-Gigabit line cards on a Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, or 9516 switch (3-6) oFabric modules for 100-Gigabit –E line cards on a Cisco Nexus 9504 or 9508 switch (4) oFabric modules for 100-Gigabit –S line cards on a Cisco Nexus 9504 or 9508 switch (4) ·Fan modules oCisco Nexus 92304QC, 9236C, and 93120TX switches (2) oCisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switch (3) oCisco Nexus 92160YC-X, 9236C, 93108TC-EX, 93180YC-EX, 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372PX-E, 9372TX, or9372TX-E switch (4) oCisco Nexus 9504, 9508, or 9516 switch (3) ·Power supplies o650-W AC, or 930-W DC, or 1200-W HVAC/HVDC power supplies (2 for the Cisco Nexus 92160YC-X, 92304QC, 9236C, 93108TC-EX, 93180YC-EX, 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372PX-E, 9372TX, 9372TX-E, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches o1200-W AC power supplies (1 or 2) or 930-W DC power supplies (1 or 2) for the Cisco Nexus 9272Q, 93120TX, 93128TX, and 9336PQ switches o3000-W AC power supplies or 3000-W Universal AC/DC or 3000-W DC power supplies for Cisco Nexus 9500 switches §Cisco Nexus 9504 switch (up to 4) §Cisco Nexus 9508 switch (up to 8) §Cisco Nexus 9516 switch (up to 10) ·Uplink module (Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches only) oM4PC-CFP2 oM6PQ oM6PQ-E oM12PQ You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode but not required for a switch running in ACI-mode).

This document lists the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series FPGA/EPLD Upgrade Release Notes, Release 7.0(3)I4(3) also applies to Release 7.0(3)I4(4), 7.0(3)I4(5), 7.0(3)I4(6), 7.0(3)I4(7), 7.0(3)I4(8), 7.0(3)I4(8a), and 7.0(3)I4(8b). The following table lists the changes to this document. Date Description January 3, 2019 Updated upgrade tables to include all applicable releases. September 4, 2018 Updated to note that the Release 7.0.(3)I4(3) also applies to Release 7.0(3)I4(5) and 7.0(3)I4(6). November 21, 2016 Included Caution statements about not matching EPLD images to NX-OS software releases. August 2, 2016 Created the release notes for Release 7.0(3)I4(3).  The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at this time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart upgrade.

This document lists the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. The following table lists the changes to this document. Date Description July 05, 2017 Created the release notes for Release 7.0(3)I4(8z).  The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at this time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the following hardware: ■Supervisor modules (2)—each with at least 800 MB of available bootflash memory (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) ■System controller modules (2) (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) ■Line cards (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) —Cisco Nexus 9504 switch (1-4) —Cisco Nexus 9508 switch (1-8) —Cisco Nexus 9516 switch (1-16) ■Fabric modules (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) —Fabric modules for 40-Gigabit line cards on a Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, or 9516 switch (3-6) —Fabric modules for 100-Gigabit –E line cards on a Cisco Nexus 9504 or 9508 switch (4) —Fabric modules for 100-Gigabit –S line cards on a Cisco Nexus 9504 or 9508 switch (4) ■Fan modules —Cisco Nexus 93120TX switch (2) —Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switch (3) —Cisco Nexus 93108TC-EX, 93180YC-EX, 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372PX-E, 9372TX, or 9372TX-E switch (4) —Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, or 9516 switch (3) ■Power supplies —650-W AC, or 930-W DC, or 1200-W HVAC/HVDC power supplies (2 for the Cisco Nexus 92160YC-X, 92304QC, 93108TC-EX, 93180YC-EX, 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372PX-E, 9372TX, 9372TX-E, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches —1200-W AC power supplies (1 or 2) or 930-W DC power supplies (1 or 2) for the Cisco Nexus 9272Q, 93120TX, 93128TX, and 9336PQ switches —3000-W AC power supplies or 3000-W Universal AC/DC or 3000-W DC power supplies for Cisco Nexus 9500 switches §Cisco Nexus 9504 switch (up to 4) §Cisco Nexus 9508 switch (up to 8) §Cisco Nexus 9516 switch (up to 10) ■Uplink module (Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches only) —M4PC-CFP2 —M6PQ —M6PQ-E —M12PQ You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode but not required for a switch running in ACI-mode).

This document lists the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. The following table lists the changes to this document. Date Description May 16, 2016 Created the release notes for Release 7.0(3)I4(1). November 21, 2016 Included Caution statements about not matching EPLD images to NX-OS releases. March 15, 2017 Added MI FPGA images for Cisco Nexus 93120TX switches.  The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at this time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart upgrade.

This document lists the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. The following table lists the changes to this document. Date Description July 18, 2016 Created the release notes for Release 7.0(3)I4(2). November 21, 2016 Included Caution statements about not matchin EPLD images to NX-OS software releases.  The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NOTE:EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at this time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NOTE:The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. NOTE:Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart upgrade.

Contents First Published: February 08, 2016 This document lists\n\t\t  the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them\n\t\t  for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. The following table\n\t\t  shows the history of changes for this document. Date Description February\n\t\t\t\t\t\t8, 2016 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 7.0(3)I3(1). February\n\t\t\t\t\t\t9, 2016 Included\n\t\t\t\t\t\tN9K-C9464TX-2 I/O module and N3K-C3232C switch. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries ACI-mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs)\n\t\tthat provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic\n\t\tprogrammable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware\n\t\tfunctionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable\n\t\tlogic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex\n\t\tprogrammable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this\n\t\tdocument, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of\n\t\thaving EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those\n\t\tfunctions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their\n\t\thardware. EPLD image upgrades\n\t\t  for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the\n\t\t  module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD\n\t\t  upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only\n\t\t  the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the\n\t\tlatest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as\n\t\tprovided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated.\n\t\tThese EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD\n\t\timage upgrades are independent from the Cisco ACI In Service Software Upgrade\n\t\t(ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact\n\t\ton the network environment. When Cisco makes an\n\t\tEPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability,\n\t\tand you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended\n\t\tif your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level\n\t\tof traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at\n\t\tthis time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should\n\t\t  execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The\n\t\t  system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart\n\t\t  upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the\n\t\tfollowing hardware: Supervisor\n\t\t\t modules—one or two, each with at least 200 MB of available bootflash memory\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) System controller\n\t\t\t modules—one or two (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) I/O modules\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) One to four\n\t\t\t\t  modules for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch One to eight\n\t\t\t\t  modules for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch One to sixteen\n\t\t\t\t  modules for the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch Fabric\n\t\t\t modules—three to six (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) Fan modules Two for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 9272Q and 93120TX switch Three for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches Four for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 92160YC-X, 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372PX-E, 9372TX, and 9372TX-E switches Fan trays Three for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 modular switches Power supplies One or two\n\t\t\t\t  650-W AC power supplies or one or two 930-W DC power supplies for the Cisco\n\t\t\t\t  Nexus 92160YC-X, 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372PX-E, 9372TX, 9372TX-E, 9396PX, and 9396TX\n\t\t\t\t  switches One or two\n\t\t\t\t  1200-W AC or one or two 930-W DC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9272Q,\n\t\t\t\t  93120TX, 93128TX, and 9336PQ switches Up to four\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies or up to four 3000-W Universal AC/DC power supplies\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch Up to eight\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies or up to eight 3000-W Universal AC/DC power supplies\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch Up to 10\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies or up to 10 3000-W Universal AC/DC power supplies for\n\t\t\t\t  the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch Uplink module\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches only) M4PC-CFP2 M6PQ M6PQ-E M12PQ You must be able to\n\t\taccess the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a\n\t\tswitch running in NX-OS mode but not required for a switch running in\n\t\tACI-mode).

Contents First Published: March 15, 2016 This document lists\n\t\t  the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them\n\t\t  for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. The following table\n\t\t  shows the history of changes for this document. Date Description March 15,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2016 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 7.0(3)I2(3). The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries ACI-mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs)\n\t\tthat provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic\n\t\tprogrammable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware\n\t\tfunctionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable\n\t\tlogic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex\n\t\tprogrammable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this\n\t\tdocument, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of\n\t\thaving EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those\n\t\tfunctions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their\n\t\thardware. EPLD image upgrades\n\t\t  for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the\n\t\t  module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD\n\t\t  upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only\n\t\t  the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the\n\t\tlatest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as\n\t\tprovided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated.\n\t\tThese EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD\n\t\timage upgrades are independent from the Cisco ACI In Service Software Upgrade\n\t\t(ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact\n\t\ton the network environment. When Cisco makes an\n\t\tEPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability,\n\t\tand you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended\n\t\tif your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level\n\t\tof traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at\n\t\tthis time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should\n\t\t  execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The\n\t\t  system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart\n\t\t  upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the\n\t\tfollowing hardware: Supervisor\n\t\t\t modules—one or two, each with at least 200 MB of available bootflash memory\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) System controller\n\t\t\t modules—one or two (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) I/O modules\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) One to four\n\t\t\t\t  modules for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch One to eight\n\t\t\t\t  modules for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch One to sixteen\n\t\t\t\t  modules for the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch Fabric\n\t\t\t modules—three to six (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) Fan modules Two for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 93120TX switch Three for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches Four for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372PX-E, and 9372TX switches Fan trays Three for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 modular switches Power supplies One or two\n\t\t\t\t  650-W AC power supplies or one or two 930-W DC power supplies for the Cisco\n\t\t\t\t  Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372PX-E, 9372TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches One or two\n\t\t\t\t  1200-W AC or one or two 930-W DC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 93120TX,\n\t\t\t\t  93128TX, and 9336PQ switches Up to four\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies or up to four 3000-W Universal AC/DC power supplies\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch Up to eight\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies or up to eight 3000-W Universal AC/DC power supplies\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch Up to 10\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies or up to 10 3000-W Universal AC/DC power supplies for\n\t\t\t\t  the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch Uplink module\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches only) M4PC-CFP2 M6PQ M6PQ-E M12PQ You must be able to\n\t\taccess the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a\n\t\tswitch running in NX-OS mode but not required for a switch running in\n\t\tACI-mode).

Contents First Published: March 01, 2016 This document lists\n\t\t  the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them\n\t\t  for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. The following table\n\t\t  shows the history of changes for this document. Date Description March 1,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2016 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 7.0(3)I2(2b). The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries ACI-mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs)\n\t\tthat provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic\n\t\tprogrammable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware\n\t\tfunctionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable\n\t\tlogic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex\n\t\tprogrammable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this\n\t\tdocument, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of\n\t\thaving EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those\n\t\tfunctions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their\n\t\thardware. EPLD image upgrades\n\t\t  for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the\n\t\t  module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD\n\t\t  upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only\n\t\t  the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the\n\t\tlatest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as\n\t\tprovided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated.\n\t\tThese EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD\n\t\timage upgrades are independent from the Cisco ACI In Service Software Upgrade\n\t\t(ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact\n\t\ton the network environment. When Cisco makes an\n\t\tEPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability,\n\t\tand you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended\n\t\tif your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level\n\t\tof traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at\n\t\tthis time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should\n\t\t  execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The\n\t\t  system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart\n\t\t  upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS\n\t\toperating system and include the following hardware: Supervisor modules—one or two, each with at least 200 MB of\n\t\t\t available bootflash memory (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) System controller modules—one or two (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and\n\t\t\t 9516 switches) I/O modules (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) One to four modules for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch One to eight modules for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch One to sixteen modules for the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch Fabric modules—three to six (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516\n\t\t\t switches) Fan modules Two for the Cisco Nexus 93120TX switch Three for the Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches Four for the Cisco Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372PX-E, and 9372TX\n\t\t\t\t  switches Fan trays Three for the Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 modular switches Power supplies One or two 650-W AC power supplies or one or two 930-W DC power\n\t\t\t\t  supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372PX-E, 9372TX, 9396PX, and\n\t\t\t\t  9396TX switches One or two 1200-W AC or one or two 930-W DC power supplies for\n\t\t\t\t  the Cisco Nexus 93120TX, 93128TX, and 9336PQ switches Up to four 3000-W AC power supplies or up to four 3000-W\n\t\t\t\t  Universal AC/DC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch Up to eight 3000-W AC power supplies or up to eight 3000-W\n\t\t\t\t  Universal AC/DC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch Up to 10 3000-W AC power supplies or up to 10 3000-W Universal\n\t\t\t\t  AC/DC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch Uplink module (Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches\n\t\t\t only) M4PC-CFP2 M6PQ M6PQ-E M12PQ You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet\n\t\t(required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode but not required for a\n\t\tswitch running in ACI-mode). You must have administrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switch. Each EPLD image that\n\t\t  you can download fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.comis\n\t\t  a bundle of EPLD upgrades.

You should\n\t\t  execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The\n\t\t  system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart\n\t\t  upgrade.

Contents This document lists\n\t\t  the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them\n\t\t  for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. The following table\n\t\t  shows the history of changes for this document. Date Description September\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4, 2015 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 7.0(3)i2(1). October 27, 2015 Updated for Release 7.0(3)i2(1a). The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switches and the Cisco Nexus 3000 Series switches contain several\n\t\tprogrammable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in\n\t\tall modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image\n\t\tupgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs\n\t\tinclude electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate\n\t\tarrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not\n\t\tinclude ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of\n\t\thaving EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those\n\t\tfunctions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their\n\t\thardware. EPLD image upgrades\n\t\t  for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the\n\t\t  module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD\n\t\t  upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only\n\t\t  the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the\n\t\tlatest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as\n\t\tprovided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated.\n\t\tThese EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD\n\t\timage upgrades are independent from the Cisco NX-OS In Service Software Upgrade\n\t\t(ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact\n\t\ton the network environment. When Cisco makes an\n\t\tEPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability,\n\t\tand you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended\n\t\tif your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level\n\t\tof traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at\n\t\tthis time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should\n\t\t  execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The\n\t\t  system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart\n\t\t  upgrade.

Contents This document lists\n\t\t  the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them\n\t\t  for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. The following table\n\t\t  shows the history of changes for this document. Date Description September\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4, 2015 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 7.0(3)I2(1). October\n\t\t\t\t\t\t28, 2015 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 7.0(3)I2(2). The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switches and the Cisco Nexus 3000 Series switches contain several\n\t\tprogrammable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in\n\t\tall modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image\n\t\tupgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs\n\t\tinclude electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate\n\t\tarrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not\n\t\tinclude ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of\n\t\thaving EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those\n\t\tfunctions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their\n\t\thardware. EPLD image upgrades\n\t\t  for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the\n\t\t  module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD\n\t\t  upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only\n\t\t  the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the\n\t\tlatest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as\n\t\tprovided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated.\n\t\tThese EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD\n\t\timage upgrades are independent from the Cisco NX-OS In Service Software Upgrade\n\t\t(ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact\n\t\ton the network environment. When Cisco makes an\n\t\tEPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability,\n\t\tand you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended\n\t\tif your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level\n\t\tof traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at\n\t\tthis time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should\n\t\t  execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The\n\t\t  system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart\n\t\t  upgrade.

Contents This document lists\n\t\t  the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them\n\t\t  for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. The following table\n\t\t  shows the history of changes for this document. Date Description September\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4, 2015 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 7.0(3)i2(1). March 15, 2017 Included MI FPGA images for Cisco Nexus 93120TX switches. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries ACI-mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs)\n\t\tthat provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic\n\t\tprogrammable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware\n\t\tfunctionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable\n\t\tlogic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex\n\t\tprogrammable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this\n\t\tdocument, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of\n\t\thaving EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those\n\t\tfunctions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their\n\t\thardware. EPLD image upgrades\n\t\t  for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the\n\t\t  module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD\n\t\t  upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only\n\t\t  the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the\n\t\tlatest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as\n\t\tprovided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated.\n\t\tThese EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD\n\t\timage upgrades are independent from the Cisco ACI In Service Software Upgrade\n\t\t(ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact\n\t\ton the network environment. When Cisco makes an\n\t\tEPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability,\n\t\tand you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended\n\t\tif your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level\n\t\tof traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at\n\t\tthis time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should\n\t\t  execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The\n\t\t  system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart\n\t\t  upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the\n\t\tfollowing hardware: Supervisor\n\t\t\t modules—one or two, each with at least 200 MB of available bootflash memory\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches)  System controller\n\t\t\t modules—one or two (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches)  I/O modules\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches)  One to four\n\t\t\t\t  modules for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch  One to eight\n\t\t\t\t  modules for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch  One to sixteen\n\t\t\t\t  modules for the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch  Fabric\n\t\t\t modules—three to six (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches)  Fan modules  Two for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 93120TX switch  Three for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches  Four for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372PX-E, and 9372TX switches  Fan trays  Three for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 modular switches  Power supplies  One or two\n\t\t\t\t  650-W AC power supplies or one or two 930-W DC power supplies for the Cisco\n\t\t\t\t  Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372PX-E, 9372TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches  One or two\n\t\t\t\t  1200-W AC or one or two 930-W DC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 93120TX,\n\t\t\t\t  93128TX, and 9336PQ switches  Up to four\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies or up to four 3000-W Universal AC/DC power supplies\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch  Up to eight\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies or up to eight 3000-W Universal AC/DC power supplies\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch  Up to 10\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies or up to 10 3000-W Universal AC/DC power supplies for\n\t\t\t\t  the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch  Uplink module\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches only)  M4PC-CFP2  M6PQ  M6PQ-E  M12PQ  You must be able to\n\t\taccess the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a\n\t\tswitch running in NX-OS mode but not required for a switch running in\n\t\tACI-mode).

        "content": "HomeSkip to contentSkip to navigationSkip to footer Cisco.com Worldwide Home  Contents This document lists\n\t\t  the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them\n\t\t  for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. The following table\n\t\t  shows the history of changes for this document. Date Description May 17,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2015 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 7.0(3)i1(2). May 27,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2015 Removedwrite_erasecommand step and note from Updating the EPLD Images section. July 7,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2015 Included\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupgrade process changes. August 21, 2015 Updated for Release 7.0(3)i1(3). The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that\n\t\tprovide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic\n\t\tprogrammable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware\n\t\tfunctionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable\n\t\tlogic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex\n\t\tprogrammable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this\n\t\tdocument, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of\n\t\thaving EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those\n\t\tfunctions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their\n\t\thardware. EPLD image upgrades\n\t\t  for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the\n\t\t  module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD\n\t\t  upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only\n\t\t  the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the\n\t\tlatest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as\n\t\tprovided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated.\n\t\tThese EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD\n\t\timage upgrades are independent from the Cisco NX-OS In Service Software Upgrade\n\t\t(ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact\n\t\ton the network environment. When Cisco makes an\n\t\tEPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability,\n\t\tand you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended\n\t\tif your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level\n\t\tof traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at\n\t\tthis time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should\n\t\t  execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The\n\t\t  system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart\n\t\t  upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the\n\t\tfollowing hardware: Supervisor\n\t\t\t modules—one or two, each with at least 200 MB of available bootflash memory\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) System controller\n\t\t\t modules—one or two (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) I/O modules\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) One to four\n\t\t\t\t  modules for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch One to eight\n\t\t\t\t  modules for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch One to sixteen\n\t\t\t\t  modules for the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch Fabric\n\t\t\t modules—three to six (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) Fan modules Two for the Cisco Nexus 93120TX switch Three for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches Four for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, and 9372TX switches Fan trays Three for the Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 modular switches Power supplies One or two\n\t\t\t\t  650-W AC power supplies or one or two 930-W DC power supplies for the Cisco\n\t\t\t\t  Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches One or two\n\t\t\t\t  1200-W AC or one or two 930-W DC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 93120TX,\n\t\t\t\t  93128TX, and 9336PQ switches Up to four\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies or up to four 3000-W Universal AC/DC power supplies\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch Up to eight\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies or up to eight 3000-W Universal AC/DC power supplies\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch Up to 10\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies or up to 10 3000-W Universal AC/DC power supplies for\n\t\t\t\t  the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch Uplink module\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches only) M4PC-CFP2 M6PQ M12PQ You must be able to\n\t\taccess the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a\n\t\tswitch running in NX-OS mode but not required for a switch running in\n\t\tACI-mode).

Contents This document lists\n\t\t  the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them\n\t\t  for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches and Cisco Nexus 3000 Series\n\t\t  switches. The following table\n\t\t  shows the history of changes for this document. Date Description May 17,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2015 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 7.0(3)i1(2). May 27,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2015 Removedwrite_erasecommand step and note from Updating the EPLD Images section. July 7,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2015 Included\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupgrade process changes. August 21,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2015 Updated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor Release 7.0(3)i1(3). October 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2015 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 7.0(3)IX1(2). The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switches and the Cisco Nexus 3000 Series switches contain several\n\t\tprogrammable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in\n\t\tall modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image\n\t\tupgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs\n\t\tinclude electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate\n\t\tarrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not\n\t\tinclude ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of\n\t\thaving EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those\n\t\tfunctions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their\n\t\thardware. EPLD image upgrades\n\t\t  for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the\n\t\t  module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD\n\t\t  upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only\n\t\t  the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the\n\t\tlatest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as\n\t\tprovided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated.\n\t\tThese EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD\n\t\timage upgrades are independent from the Cisco NX-OS In Service Software Upgrade\n\t\t(ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact\n\t\ton the network environment. When Cisco makes an\n\t\tEPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability,\n\t\tand you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended\n\t\tif your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level\n\t\tof traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at\n\t\tthis time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should\n\t\t  execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The\n\t\t  system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart\n\t\t  upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switch and the Cisco Nexus 3000 Series switch must be running the Cisco\n\t\tNX-OS operating system and include the following hardware: Supervisor\n\t\t\t modules—one or two, each with at least 200 MB of available bootflash memory\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) System controller\n\t\t\t modules—one or two (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) I/O modules\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) One to four\n\t\t\t\t  modules for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch One to eight\n\t\t\t\t  modules for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch One to sixteen\n\t\t\t\t  modules for the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch Fabric\n\t\t\t modules—three to six (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) Fan modules Two for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 93120TX switch Three for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches Four for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, and 9372TX switches Fan trays Three for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 modular switches Power supplies One or two\n\t\t\t\t  650-W AC power supplies or one or two 930-W DC power supplies for the Cisco\n\t\t\t\t  Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches One or two\n\t\t\t\t  1200-W AC or one or two 930-W DC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 93120TX,\n\t\t\t\t  93128TX, and 9336PQ switches Up to four\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies or up to four 3000-W Universal AC/DC power supplies\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch Up to eight\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies or up to eight 3000-W Universal AC/DC power supplies\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch Up to 10\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies or up to 10 3000-W Universal AC/DC power supplies for\n\t\t\t\t  the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch Uplink module\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches only) M4PC-CFP2 M6PQ M12PQ You must be able to\n\t\taccess the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a\n\t\tswitch running in NX-OS mode but not required for a switch running in\n\t\tACI-mode).

Contents First Published: January 25, 2016 This document lists\n\t\t  the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them\n\t\t  for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches and Cisco Nexus 3000 Series\n\t\t  switches. The following table\n\t\t  shows the history of changes for this document. Date Description January\n\t\t\t\t\t\t19, 2016 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 7.0(3)i1(2a). The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries ACI-mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs)\n\t\tthat provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic\n\t\tprogrammable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware\n\t\tfunctionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable\n\t\tlogic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex\n\t\tprogrammable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this\n\t\tdocument, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of\n\t\thaving EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those\n\t\tfunctions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their\n\t\thardware. EPLD image upgrades\n\t\t  for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the\n\t\t  module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD\n\t\t  upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only\n\t\t  the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the\n\t\tlatest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as\n\t\tprovided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated.\n\t\tThese EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD\n\t\timage upgrades are independent from the Cisco ACI In Service Software Upgrade\n\t\t(ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact\n\t\ton the network environment. When Cisco makes an\n\t\tEPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability,\n\t\tand you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended\n\t\tif your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level\n\t\tof traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at\n\t\tthis time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should\n\t\t  execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The\n\t\t  system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart\n\t\t  upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switch and the Cisco Nexus 3000 Series switch must be running the Cisco\n\t\tNX-OS operating system and include the following hardware: Supervisor\n\t\t\t modules—one or two, each with at least 200 MB of available bootflash memory\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) System controller\n\t\t\t modules—one or two (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) I/O modules\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) One to four\n\t\t\t\t  modules for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch One to eight\n\t\t\t\t  modules for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch One to sixteen\n\t\t\t\t  modules for the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch Fabric\n\t\t\t modules—three to six (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches) Fan modules Two for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 93120TX switch Three for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches Four for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, and 9372TX switches Fan trays Three for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 modular switches Power supplies One or two\n\t\t\t\t  650-W AC power supplies or one or two 930-W DC power supplies for the Cisco\n\t\t\t\t  Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches One or two\n\t\t\t\t  1200-W AC or one or two 930-W DC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 93120TX,\n\t\t\t\t  93128TX, and 9336PQ switches Up to four\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies or up to four 3000-W Universal AC/DC power supplies\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch Up to eight\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies or up to eight 3000-W Universal AC/DC power supplies\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch Up to 10\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies or up to 10 3000-W Universal AC/DC power supplies for\n\t\t\t\t  the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch Uplink module\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches only) M4PC-CFP2 M6PQ M12PQ You must be able to\n\t\taccess the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a\n\t\tswitch running in NX-OS mode but not required for a switch running in\n\t\tACI-mode).

Contents This document lists\n\t\t  the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them\n\t\t  for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. The following table\n\t\t  shows the history of changes for this document. Date Description May 17,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2015 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 7.0(3)i1(2). May 27,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2015 Removedwrite_erasecommand step and note\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Updating the EPLD Images section. July 7, 2015 Included upgrade process changes. March 15, 2017 Included MI FPGA images for Cisco Nexus 93120TX switch. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries ACI-mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs)\n\t\tthat provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic\n\t\tprogrammable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware\n\t\tfunctionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable\n\t\tlogic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex\n\t\tprogrammable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this\n\t\tdocument, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of\n\t\thaving EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those\n\t\tfunctions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their\n\t\thardware. EPLD image upgrades\n\t\t  for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the\n\t\t  module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD\n\t\t  upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only\n\t\t  the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the\n\t\tlatest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as\n\t\tprovided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated.\n\t\tThese EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD\n\t\timage upgrades are independent from the Cisco ACI In Service Software Upgrade\n\t\t(ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact\n\t\ton the network environment. When Cisco makes an\n\t\tEPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability,\n\t\tand you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended\n\t\tif your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level\n\t\tof traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at\n\t\tthis time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should\n\t\t  execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The\n\t\t  system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart\n\t\t  upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the\n\t\tfollowing hardware: Supervisor\n\t\t\t modules—one or two, each with at least 200 MB of available bootflash memory\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches)  System controller\n\t\t\t modules—one or two (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches)  I/O modules\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches)  One to four\n\t\t\t\t  modules for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch  One to eight\n\t\t\t\t  modules for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch  One to sixteen\n\t\t\t\t  modules for the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch  Fabric\n\t\t\t modules—three to six (Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 switches)  Fan modules  Two for the Cisco Nexus 93120TX switch  Three for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches  Four for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, and 9372TX switches  Fan trays  Three for the Cisco Nexus 9504, 9508, and 9516 modular switches  Power supplies  One or two\n\t\t\t\t  650-W AC power supplies or one or two 930-W DC power supplies for the Cisco\n\t\t\t\t  Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches  One or two\n\t\t\t\t  1200-W AC or one or two 930-W DC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 93120TX,\n\t\t\t\t  93128TX, and 9336PQ switches  Up to four\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies or up to four 3000-W Universal AC/DC power supplies\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch  Up to eight\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies or up to eight 3000-W Universal AC/DC power supplies\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch  Up to 10\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies or up to 10 3000-W Universal AC/DC power supplies for\n\t\t\t\t  the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch  Uplink module\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 9396TX switches only)  M4PC-CFP2  M6PQ  M12PQ  You must be able to\n\t\taccess the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a\n\t\tswitch running in NX-OS mode but not required for a switch running in\n\t\tACI-mode).

August 7, 2015 Created the release notes for Release 6.1(2)i3(5). The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that\n\t\tprovide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic\n\t\tprogrammable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware\n\t\tfunctionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable\n\t\tlogic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex\n\t\tprogrammable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this\n\t\tdocument, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of\n\t\thaving EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those\n\t\tfunctions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their\n\t\thardware. EPLD image upgrades\n\t\t  for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the\n\t\t  module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD\n\t\t  upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only\n\t\t  the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the\n\t\tlatest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as\n\t\tprovided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated.\n\t\tThese EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD\n\t\timage upgrades are independent from the Cisco NX-OS In Service Software Upgrade\n\t\t(ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact\n\t\ton the network environment. When Cisco makes an\n\t\tEPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability,\n\t\tand you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended\n\t\tif your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level\n\t\tof traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at\n\t\tthis time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should\n\t\t  execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The\n\t\t  system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart\n\t\t  upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the\n\t\tfollowing hardware: Supervisor\n\t\t\t modules—one or two, each with at least 200 MB of available bootflash memory\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) System controller\n\t\t\t modules—one or two (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) I/O modules\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) One to four\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch One to eight\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch One to sixteen\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch Fabric\n\t\t\t modules—three or six (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) Fan modules Three for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, 9396TX, and 95xxswitches Four for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, and 9372TX switches Power supplies One or two\n\t\t\t\t  650-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372TX, 9396PX, and\n\t\t\t\t  9396TX switches One or two\n\t\t\t\t  1200-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 93128TX, and 9336PQ switches Up to four\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch Up to eight\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch Up to 10\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch Uplink module\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 93xxxswitches only) M6PQ M12PQ You must be able to\n\t\taccess the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a\n\t\tswitch running in NX-OS mode but not required for a switch running in\n\t\tACI-mode).

The following table\n\t\t  shows the history of changes for this document. Date Description October\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2014 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 6.1(2)i3(1).

February\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4, 2015 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 6.1(2)i3(3a). March 24,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2015 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 6.1(2)i3(4). May 27,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2015 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 6.1(2)i3(4a). July 7, 2015 Included upgrade process changes. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that\n\t\tprovide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic\n\t\tprogrammable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware\n\t\tfunctionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable\n\t\tlogic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex\n\t\tprogrammable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this\n\t\tdocument, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of\n\t\thaving EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those\n\t\tfunctions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their\n\t\thardware. EPLD image upgrades\n\t\t  for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the\n\t\t  module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD\n\t\t  upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only\n\t\t  the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the\n\t\tlatest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as\n\t\tprovided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated.\n\t\tThese EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD\n\t\timage upgrades are independent from the Cisco NX-OS In Service Software Upgrade\n\t\t(ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact\n\t\ton the network environment. When Cisco makes an\n\t\tEPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability,\n\t\tand you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended\n\t\tif your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level\n\t\tof traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at\n\t\tthis time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should\n\t\t  execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The\n\t\t  system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart\n\t\t  upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the\n\t\tfollowing hardware: Supervisor\n\t\t\t modules—one or two, each with at least 200 MB of available bootflash memory\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) System controller\n\t\t\t modules—one or two (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) I/O modules\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) One to four\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch One to eight\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch One to sixteen\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch Fabric\n\t\t\t modules—three or six (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) Fan modules Three for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, 9396TX, and 95xxswitches Four for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, and 9372TX switches Power supplies One or two\n\t\t\t\t  650-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372TX, 9396PX, and\n\t\t\t\t  9396TX switches One or two\n\t\t\t\t  1200-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 93128TX and 9336PQ switches Up to four\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch Up to eight\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch Up to 10\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch Uplink module\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 93xxxswitches only) M6PQ M12PQ You must be able to\n\t\taccess the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a\n\t\tswitch running in NX-OS mode but not required for a switch running in\n\t\tACI-mode).

May 27,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2015 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 6.1(2)i3(4a). July 2,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2015 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 6.1(2)i3(4b). The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that\n\t\tprovide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic\n\t\tprogrammable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware\n\t\tfunctionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable\n\t\tlogic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex\n\t\tprogrammable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this\n\t\tdocument, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of\n\t\thaving EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those\n\t\tfunctions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their\n\t\thardware. EPLD image upgrades\n\t\t  for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the\n\t\t  module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD\n\t\t  upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only\n\t\t  the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the\n\t\tlatest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as\n\t\tprovided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated.\n\t\tThese EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD\n\t\timage upgrades are independent from the Cisco NX-OS In Service Software Upgrade\n\t\t(ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact\n\t\ton the network environment. When Cisco makes an\n\t\tEPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability,\n\t\tand you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended\n\t\tif your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level\n\t\tof traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at\n\t\tthis time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should\n\t\t  execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The\n\t\t  system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart\n\t\t  upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the\n\t\tfollowing hardware: Supervisor\n\t\t\t modules—one or two, each with at least 200 MB of available bootflash memory\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) System controller\n\t\t\t modules—one or two (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) I/O modules\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) One to four\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch One to eight\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch One to sixteen\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch Fabric\n\t\t\t modules—three or six (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) Fan modules Three for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, 9396TX, and 95xxswitches Four for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, and 9372TX switches Power supplies One or two\n\t\t\t\t  650-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372TX, 9396PX, and\n\t\t\t\t  9396TX switches One or two\n\t\t\t\t  1200-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 93128TX and 9336PQ switches Up to four\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch Up to eight\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch Up to 10\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch Uplink module\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 93xxxswitches only) M6PQ M12PQ You must be able to\n\t\taccess the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a\n\t\tswitch running in NX-OS mode but not required for a switch running in\n\t\tACI-mode). You must have\n\t\tadministrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. Each EPLD image that\n\t\t  you can download fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.comis\n\t\t  a bundle of EPLD upgrades.

The following table\n\t\t  shows the history of changes for this document. Date Description October\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2014 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 6.1(2)i3(1). November\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10, 2014 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 6.1(2)i3(2). December\n\t\t\t\t\t\t23, 2014 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 6.1(2)i3(3). February\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4, 2015 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 6.1(2)i3(3a). March 24,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2015 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 6.1(2)i3(4). May 27,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2015 Removed\n\t\t\t\t\t\twrite_erase command step and note from Updating the EPLD Images section. July 7, 2015 Included upgrade process changes. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that\n\t\tprovide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic\n\t\tprogrammable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware\n\t\tfunctionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable\n\t\tlogic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex\n\t\tprogrammable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this\n\t\tdocument, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of\n\t\thaving EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those\n\t\tfunctions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their\n\t\thardware. EPLD image upgrades\n\t\t  for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the\n\t\t  module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD\n\t\t  upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only\n\t\t  the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the\n\t\tlatest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as\n\t\tprovided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated.\n\t\tThese EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD\n\t\timage upgrades are independent from the Cisco NX-OS In Service Software Upgrade\n\t\t(ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact\n\t\ton the network environment. When Cisco makes an\n\t\tEPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability,\n\t\tand you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended\n\t\tif your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level\n\t\tof traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at\n\t\tthis time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should\n\t\t  execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The\n\t\t  system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart\n\t\t  upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the\n\t\tfollowing hardware: Supervisor\n\t\t\t modules—one or two, each with at least 200 MB of available bootflash memory\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) System controller\n\t\t\t modules—one or two (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) I/O modules\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) One to four\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch One to eight\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch One to sixteen\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch Fabric\n\t\t\t modules—three or six (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) Fan modules Three for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, 9396TX, and 95xxswitches Four for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, and 9372TX switches Power supplies One or two\n\t\t\t\t  650-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372TX, 9396PX, and\n\t\t\t\t  9396TX switches One or two\n\t\t\t\t  1200-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 93128TX and 9336PQ switches Up to four\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch Up to eight\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch Up to 16\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch Uplink module\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 93xxxswitches only) M6PQ M12PQ You must be able to\n\t\taccess the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a\n\t\tswitch running in NX-OS mode but not required for a switch running in\n\t\tACI-mode). You must have\n\t\tadministrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. Each EPLD image that\n\t\t  you can download fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.comis\n\t\t  a bundle of EPLD upgrades.

The following table\n\t\t  shows the history of changes for this document. Date Description October\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2014 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 6.1(2)i3(1). November\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10, 2014 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 6.1(2)i3(2). December\n\t\t\t\t\t\t23, 2014 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 6.1(2)i3(3). February\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4, 2015 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 6.1(2)i3(3a). May 28,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2015 Removed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthewrite erasestep and note. July 7, 2015 Included upgrade process changes. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that\n\t\tprovide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic\n\t\tprogrammable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware\n\t\tfunctionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable\n\t\tlogic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex\n\t\tprogrammable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this\n\t\tdocument, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of\n\t\thaving EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those\n\t\tfunctions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their\n\t\thardware. EPLD image upgrades\n\t\t  for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the\n\t\t  module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD\n\t\t  upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only\n\t\t  the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the\n\t\tlatest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as\n\t\tprovided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated.\n\t\tThese EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD\n\t\timage upgrades are independent from the Cisco NX-OS In Service Software Upgrade\n\t\t(ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact\n\t\ton the network environment. When Cisco makes an\n\t\tEPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability,\n\t\tand you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended\n\t\tif your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level\n\t\tof traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at\n\t\tthis time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should\n\t\t  execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The\n\t\t  system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart\n\t\t  upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the\n\t\tfollowing hardware: Supervisor\n\t\t\t modules—one or two, each with at least 200 MB of available bootflash memory\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) System controller\n\t\t\t modules—one or two (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) I/O modules\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) One to four\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch One to eight\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch One to sixteen\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch Fabric\n\t\t\t modules—three or six (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) Fan modules Three for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, 9396TX, and 95xxswitches Four for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, and 9372TX switches Power supplies One or two\n\t\t\t\t  650-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, 9372TX, 9396PX, and\n\t\t\t\t  9396TX switches One or two\n\t\t\t\t  1200-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 93128TX and 9336PQ switches Up to four\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9504 switch Up to eight\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9508 switch Up to 16\n\t\t\t\t  3000-W AC power supplies for the Cisco Nexus 9516 switch Uplink module\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 93xxxswitches only) M6PQ M12PQ You must be able to\n\t\taccess the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a\n\t\tswitch running in NX-OS mode but not required for a switch running in\n\t\tACI-mode). You must have\n\t\tadministrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. Each EPLD image that\n\t\t  you can download fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.comis\n\t\t  a bundle of EPLD upgrades. To see the updated EPLD versions for the Cisco Nexus\n\t\t  3164Q switch, Cisco Nexus 93xxxswitches, and the Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches, see the\n\t\t  following tables.

        "content": "HomeSkip to contentSkip to navigationSkip to footer Cisco.com Worldwide Home  Contents This document lists\n\t\t  the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them\n\t\t  for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. The following table\n\t\t  shows the history of changes for this document. Date Description October\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2014 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 6.1(2)i3(1). November\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10, 2014 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 6.1(2)i3(2). December\n\t\t\t\t\t\t23, 2014 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 6.1(2)i3(3). May 28,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2015 Removed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthewrite erasestep and note. July 7, 2015 Updated the upgrade process. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that\n\t\tprovide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic\n\t\tprogrammable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware\n\t\tfunctionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable\n\t\tlogic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex\n\t\tprogrammable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this\n\t\tdocument, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of\n\t\thaving EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those\n\t\tfunctions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their\n\t\thardware. EPLD image upgrades\n\t\t  for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the\n\t\t  module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD\n\t\t  upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only\n\t\t  the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the\n\t\tlatest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as\n\t\tprovided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated.\n\t\tThese EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD\n\t\timage upgrades are independent from the Cisco NX-OS In Service Software Upgrade\n\t\t(ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact\n\t\ton the network environment. When Cisco makes an\n\t\tEPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability,\n\t\tand you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended\n\t\tif your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level\n\t\tof traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at\n\t\tthis time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should\n\t\t  execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The\n\t\t  system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart\n\t\t  upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the\n\t\tfollowing hardware: Supervisor\n\t\t\t modules—one or two, each with at least 200 MB of available bootflash memory\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) System controller\n\t\t\t modules—one or two (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) I/O modules\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) Fabric\n\t\t\t modules—three or six (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) Fan tray modules Three for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, 9396TX, and 95xxswitches Four for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, and 9372TX switches You must be able to\n\t\taccess the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a\n\t\tswitch running in NX-OS mode but not required for a switch running in\n\t\tACI-mode). You must have\n\t\tadministrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. Each EPLD image that\n\t\t  you can download fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.comis a bundle of EPLD upgrades. To see the updated EPLD versions for the Cisco\n\t\t  Nexus 3164Q switch, Cisco Nexus 93xxxswitches, and the Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches, see the\n\t\t  following tables.

The following table\n\t\t  shows the history of changes for this document. Date Description October\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2014 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 6.1(2)i3(1).

July 7, 2015 Upgrade process changes. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that\n\t\tprovide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic\n\t\tprogrammable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware\n\t\tfunctionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable\n\t\tlogic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex\n\t\tprogrammable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this\n\t\tdocument, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of\n\t\thaving EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those\n\t\tfunctions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their\n\t\thardware. EPLD image upgrades\n\t\t  for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the\n\t\t  module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD\n\t\t  upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only\n\t\t  the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the\n\t\tlatest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as\n\t\tprovided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated.\n\t\tThese EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD\n\t\timage upgrades are independent from the Cisco NX-OS In Service Software Upgrade\n\t\t(ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact\n\t\ton the network environment. When Cisco makes an\n\t\tEPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability,\n\t\tand you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended\n\t\tif your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level\n\t\tof traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at\n\t\tthis time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should\n\t\t  execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The\n\t\t  system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart\n\t\t  upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the\n\t\tfollowing hardware: Supervisor\n\t\t\t modules—one or two, each with at least 200 MB of available bootflash memory\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) System controller\n\t\t\t modules—one or two (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) I/O modules\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) Fabric\n\t\t\t modules—three or six (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) Fan tray modules Three for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, 9396TX, and 95xxswitches Four for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, and 9372TX switches You must be able to\n\t\taccess the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a\n\t\tswitch running in NX-OS mode but not required for a switch running in\n\t\tACI-mode). You must have\n\t\tadministrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. Each EPLD image that\n\t\t  you can download fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.comis a bundle of EPLD upgrades. To see the updated EPLD versions for the Cisco\n\t\t  Nexus 3164Q switch, Cisco Nexus 93xxxswitches, and the Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches, see the\n\t\t  following tables.

        "content": "HomeSkip to contentSkip to navigationSkip to footer Cisco.com Worldwide Home  Contents This document lists\n\t\t  the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them\n\t\t  for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. The following table\n\t\t  shows the history of changes for this document. Date Description October\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2014 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 6.1(2)i3(1). May 28,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2015 Removed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthewrite erasestep and note. July 7, 2015 Upgrade process changes. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that\n\t\tprovide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic\n\t\tprogrammable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware\n\t\tfunctionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable\n\t\tlogic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex\n\t\tprogrammable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this\n\t\tdocument, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of\n\t\thaving EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those\n\t\tfunctions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their\n\t\thardware. EPLD image upgrades\n\t\t  for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the\n\t\t  module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD\n\t\t  upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only\n\t\t  the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the\n\t\tlatest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as\n\t\tprovided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated.\n\t\tThese EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD\n\t\timage upgrades are independent from the Cisco NX-OS In Service Software Upgrade\n\t\t(ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact\n\t\ton the network environment. When Cisco makes an\n\t\tEPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability,\n\t\tand you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended\n\t\tif your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level\n\t\tof traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at\n\t\tthis time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should\n\t\t  execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The\n\t\t  system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart\n\t\t  upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the\n\t\tfollowing hardware: Supervisor\n\t\t\t modules—one or two, each with at least 200 MB of available bootflash memory\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) System controller\n\t\t\t modules—one or two (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) I/O modules\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) Fabric\n\t\t\t modules—three or six (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) Fan tray modules Three for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, 9396TX, and 95xxswitches Four for the\n\t\t\t\t  Cisco Nexus 9332PQ, 9372PX, and 9372TX switches You must be able to\n\t\taccess the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a\n\t\tswitch running in NX-OS mode but not required for a switch running in\n\t\tACI-mode). You must have\n\t\tadministrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. Each EPLD image that\n\t\t  you can download fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.comis a bundle of EPLD upgrades. To see the updated EPLD versions for the Cisco\n\t\t  Nexus 3164Q switch, Cisco Nexus 93xxxswitches, and the Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches, see the\n\t\t  following tables.

Cisco Nexus 9000 Series FPGA/EPLD Upgrade  Release Notes, Release 6.1(2)I2(2a) Introduction Deciding When to Upgrade EPLDs Switch Requirements EPLDs Available for Releases 6.1(2)I2(1) through 6.1(2)I2(2a) Determining Whether to Upgrade EPLD Images Downloading the EPLD Images Installation Guidelines Upgrading the EPLD Images Verifying the EPLD Upgrades Displaying the Status of EPLD Upgrades Limitations Related Documentation Obtaining Documentation and Submitting a Service Request Release Date: June 18, 2014 Table 1shows the online history changes for this document. Table 1Online History Change March 17, 2014 Created for Cisco NX-OS Release 6.1(2)I2(1). May 7, 2014 Updated for Cisco NX-OS Release 6.1(2)I2(2). May 14, 2014 Updated the title for all 6.1(2)I2 releases. June 18, 2014 Updated for Cisco NX-OS Release 6.1(2)I2(2a) This document includes the following sections: The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches, which include the Cisco Nexus 93xxxand 95xxswitches, contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NoteEPLD image upgrades for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. To determine if there are any updated images, seeTable 2. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco NX-OS In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download them fromhttp://www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at this time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NoteThe EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. NoteDo not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the following hardware: You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet. You must have administrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. Each EPLD image that you can download fromhttp://www.cisco.comis a bundle of EPLD upgrades. To see the updated EPLD versions for the current release, seeTable 2.

If any of the versions that you list are older than what is listed inTable 2, we recommend that you update the EPLDs. You can use theshow install impact epld bootflash:command to determine whether the EPLDs can be upgraded for all the modules or for specific modules on a switch. This command indicates the current EPLD images, new EPLD images, and whether the upgrades would be disruptive to switch operations. The following example shows the results of using the show install impact epld bootflash: command on a Cisco Nexus 93xxxswitch. In this case, the MI FPGA and IO FPGA EPLD images can be upgraded for the switch supervisor (slot 1) and the MI FPGA2 EPLD image can be upgraded for the supervisor in the uplink module (slot 2). Both upgrades are disruptive. The following example shows the results of using the show install impact epld bootflash: command on a Cisco Nexus 95xxswitch. Before you canprepare the EPLD images for installation, you must download them to the FTP or management server. To download the EPLD images, follow these steps: Step 1From a browser, go to the following URL: http://www.cisco.com The browser will display the Cisco website. Step 2From the Products & Services tab, chooseSwitches. The Switches page opens. Step 3In the Data Center area, click the arrow next to View Products. The page lists the Data Center products. Step 4ClickNexus 9000. The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches page opens. Step 5In the Support area, clickDownload Software. The Downloads page opens and lists the Data Center switches.

Step 9ChooseLatest Releases>6.1(2)I2(2a). The Downloads page displays image information, including a link to the downloadable Tar file, to the right of the releases. Step 10Click the link for the Tar file. The Downloads page displays a Download button and lists information for the Tar file. Step 11ClickDownload. The Supporting Documents page opens to display the rules for downloading the software. Step 12Read the rules and clickAgree. A File Download dialog box opens to ask if you want to open or save the images file. Step 13ClickSave. The Save As dialog box appears. Step 14Indicate where to save the Tar file and clickSave. The Tar file saves to the location that you specified.  You are ready to prepare the EPLD images for Installation (see the“.” section). You can upgrade EPLDs using CLI commands on the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. Follow these guidelines when you upgrade EPLDs: –You can upgrade a module individually. –You can upgrade all modules sequentially. –You can upgrade all modules in parallel. –If the modules are online, only the EPLD images with version numbers that differ from the new EPLD images are upgraded. –If the modules are offline, all of the EPLD images are upgraded. . If you have a Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch that is running Cisco NX-OS Release 6.1(2)I2(1) build 6.1(2)I2(0.206) or any earlier build of 6.1(2)I2(0.xxx), follow the special upgrade steps presented here. NoteIf you have a Cisco Nexus 9508 switch that is running the n9000-dk9.6.1.2.I1.1.bin image from November 18, 2013, you do not need to enter the write erase command in Step 5. We do recommend upgrading EPLD images, but it is not mandatory. Step 1Copy the n9000-dk9.6.1.2.I2.1.bin image to bootflash. Step 2Change the boot variables to the NX-OS image by entering the following commands: Step 3Enter the copy running-config startup-config command to set the startup boot variables to the NX-OS image. Step 4Copy the running-configuration file to a backup-configuration file to ensure that you load the running configuration after you make the upgrade. Step 5Enter the write erase command. The boot variables remain set. Enter the reload command. On a Cisco Nexus 9508 or 9504 switch with dual supervisors, an “Autocopy in progress” message appears when you enter the reloa...",

When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended\n\t\tif your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level\n\t\tof traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at\n\t\tthis time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should\n\t\t  execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The\n\t\t  system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart\n\t\t  upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the\n\t\tfollowing hardware: Supervisor\n\t\t\t modules—one or two, each with at least 200 MB of available bootflash memory\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) System controller\n\t\t\t modules—one or two (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) I/O modules\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) one to four\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9504 one to eight\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9508 one to sixteen\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9516 Fabric\n\t\t\t modules—three or six (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) Fan tray\n\t\t\t modules—three for the Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 95xxswitches Uplink module\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 93xxxswitches only) You must be able to\n\t\taccess the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a\n\t\tswitch running in NX-OS mode but not required for a switch running in\n\t\tACI-mode). You must have\n\t\tadministrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. Each EPLD image that\n\t\t  you can download fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.comis a bundle of EPLD upgrades.

May 14, 2014 Updated the title for all 6.1(2)I2 releases. June 25, 2014 Corrected software image name extension. This document includes the following sections: The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches, which include the Cisco Nexus 93xxxand 95xxswitches, contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. NoteEPLD image upgrades for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. EPLD image upgrades for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module.  Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. To determine if there are any updated images, seeTable 2. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco NX-OS In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download them fromhttp://www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at this time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. NoteThe EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade.  NoteDo not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart upgrade. Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart upgrade.  The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the following hardware: You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet. You must have administrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. Each EPLD image that you can download fromhttp://www.cisco.comis a bundle of EPLD upgrades. To see the updated EPLD versions for the current release, seeTable 2.

If any of the versions that you list are older than what is listed inTable 2, we recommend that you update the EPLDs.  You can use theshow install impact epld bootflash:command to determine whether the EPLDs can be upgraded for all the modules or for specific modules on a switch. This command indicates the current EPLD images, new EPLD images, and whether the upgrades would be disruptive to switch operations. The following example shows the results of using the show install impact epld bootflash: command on a Cisco Nexus 93xxxswitch. In this case, the MI FPGA and IO FPGA EPLD images can be upgraded for the switch supervisor (slot 1) and the MI FPGA2 EPLD image can be upgraded for the supervisor in the uplink module (slot 2). Both upgrades are disruptive. The following example shows the results of using the show install impact epld bootflash: command on a Cisco Nexus 95xxswitch. Before you canprepare the EPLD images for installation, you must download them to the FTP or management server. To download the EPLD images, follow these steps: Step 1From a browser, go to the following URL: http://www.cisco.com The browser will display the Cisco website. Step 2From the Products & Services tab, chooseSwitches. The Switches page opens. Step 3In the Data Center area, click the arrow next to View Products. The page lists the Data Center products.

Contents This document lists\n\t\t  the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them\n\t\t  for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. The following table\n\t\t  shows the history of changes for this document. Date Description August\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2014 Created\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe release notes for Release 6.1(2)i1(3). May 28,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2014 Removed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthewrite erasestep and note. July 7, 2015 Upgrade process changes. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that\n\t\tprovide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic\n\t\tprogrammable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware\n\t\tfunctionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable\n\t\tlogic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex\n\t\tprogrammable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this\n\t\tdocument, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of\n\t\thaving EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those\n\t\tfunctions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their\n\t\thardware. EPLD image upgrades\n\t\t  for an I/O module disrupt the traffic going through the module because the\n\t\t  module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD\n\t\t  upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only\n\t\t  the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the\n\t\tlatest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as\n\t\tprovided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated.\n\t\tThese EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD\n\t\timage upgrades are independent from the Cisco NX-OS In Service Software Upgrade\n\t\t(ISSU) process, which upgrades the system and kickstart images with no impact\n\t\ton the network environment. When Cisco makes an\n\t\tEPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability,\n\t\tand you can download them fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.com. When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended\n\t\tif your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level\n\t\tof traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable at\n\t\tthis time, then you might consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. You should\n\t\t  execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The\n\t\t  system/kickstart ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system/kickstart\n\t\t  upgrade. The Cisco Nexus 9000\n\t\tSeries switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system and include the\n\t\tfollowing hardware: Supervisor\n\t\t\t modules—one or two, each with at least 200 MB of available bootflash memory\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) System controller\n\t\t\t modules—one or two (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) I/O modules\n\t\t\t (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) one to four\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9504 one to eight\n\t\t\t\t  for the Cisco Nexus 9508 Fabric\n\t\t\t modules—three or six (Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches only) Fan tray\n\t\t\t modules—three for the Cisco Nexus 93128TX, 9396PX, and 95xxswitches You must be able to\n\t\taccess the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a\n\t\tswitch running in NX-OS mode but not required for a switch running in\n\t\tACI-mode). You must have\n\t\tadministrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. Each EPLD image that\n\t\t  you can download fromhttp:/​/​www.cisco.comis a bundle of EPLD upgrades. To see the updated EPLD versions for the Cisco\n\t\t  Nexus 95xxswitches,\n\t\t  see the following table. All updates to an\n\t\t\t image are shown in boldface.

This command indicates\n\t\t  the current EPLD images, new EPLD images, and whether the upgrades would be\n\t\t  disruptive to switch operations. The following\n\t\t  example shows the results of using theshow install impact epld\n\t\t\t\tbootflash:command on a Cisco Nexus 95xxswitch. Before you can\n\t\t  prepare the EPLD images for installation, you must download them to the FTP or\n\t\t  management server. The browser will\n\t\t\t\tdisplay the Cisco website.

You can upgrade EPLDs using CLI commands on the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series\n\t\tswitch. Follow these guidelines when you upgrade EPLDs: Before you upgrade any EPLD images, be sure that you have updated\n\t\t\t the Cisco NX-OS operating system to the level required for the images and be\n\t\t\t sure that you have an EPLD image file. You can execute an upgrade from the active supervisor module only.\n\t\t\t This upgrade is for one or all of the modules as follows: You can upgrade a module individually. You can upgrade all modules sequentially. You can upgrade all modules in parallel. You can update the images for one or all modules whether the switch\n\t\t\t is online or offline as follows: If the modules are online, only the EPLD images with version\n\t\t\t\t  numbers that differ from the new EPLD images are upgraded. If the modules are offline, all of the EPLD images are upgraded. On a Cisco Nexus 95xxswitch that has two supervisor\n\t\t\t modules, upgrade the EPLDs for the standby supervisor and then switch the\n\t\t\t active supervisor to the standby mode to upgrade its EPLDs (the supervisor\n\t\t\t switchover is not disruptive to traffic on Cisco Nexus 95xxswitches).\n\t\t\t On a switch that has only one supervisor module, you can upgrade the active\n\t\t\t supervisor, but this will disrupt its operations during the upgrade. If you interrupt an upgrade, you must upgrade the module that is\n\t\t\t being upgraded again. The upgrade process disrupts traffic on the targeted module. Do not insert or remove any modules while an EPLD upgrade is in\n\t\t\t progress. If you have a Cisco\n\t\t  Nexus 9000 Series switch that is running Cisco NX-OS Release 6.1(2)I1(3) build\n\t\t  or later build, follow the special upgrade steps presented here. You can verify the EPLD upgrades\n\t\t  for each slot in a modular switch by using the command theshow version moduleslot_numberepldcommand. To display the status of EPLD\n\t\t  upgrades on the switch, use theshow install epld statuscommand. When EPLDs are\n\t\tupgraded, the following guidelines and observations apply: If a module is\n\t\t\t not online, you cannot upgrade its EPLD images. If there are two\n\t\t\t supervisors installed in the switch (Cisco Nexus 9504 and 9508 only), you can\n\t\t\t either upgrade only the standby supervisor from the active supervisor or\n\t\t\t upgrade all modules (including both supervisor modules) by using the following\n\t\t\t commands: install epld bootflash:imagemodulestandby_supervisor_slot_number(upgrades only the\n\t\t\t\t  standby supervisor module) After you\n\t\t\t\t\t use this command, you can switchover the active and standby supervisor modules\n\t\t\t\t\t and then upgrade the other supervisor. install epld bootflash:imagemodule\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall(upgrades all of the modules) If there is only\n\t\t\t one supervisor installed in the switch, your upgrading or downgrading of EPLD\n\t\t\t images is disruptive.

Feb 4, 2025 Fixed values for N9K-C93180YC-FX3H Introduction The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. Note: EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images from https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html . When choosing an EPLD version for upgrade, ensure you have already installed the corresponding NXOS software version first. It is generally not supported to upgrade to a newer EPLD image built for a future version of NXOS while running on an older NXOS version, unless explicitly supported as per the specific EPLD Release Notes. NXOS and EPLD images are labeled for their related version to avoid any unsupported upgrades. When to Upgrade EPLDs When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. Note: The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Note: Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. Note: The EPLD version is backward compatible. The NXOS software can be downgraded for the switch and the EPLD version does not have to be downgraded to match the older NXOS version. Switch Requirements · The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system. · You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode). · You must have administrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. EPLD Upgrades Available for NX-OS Mode Releases 10.3(1) through 10.5(1) Each EPLD image that you can download from Software Download page is a bundle of EPLD upgrades packaged into a single EPLD image file. To see the available EPLD versions for the Nexus 9000 standalone and module switches on this release, see the tables. Note: All updates to an image are shown in boldface. If more than one release is shown for a column, the boldface applies to the first release listed for the column.

        "content": "This document lists the current and past versions of EPLD images and describes how to update them for use with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches. This document also covers later releases. If a new Cisco Nexus 9000 Series FPGA/EPLD Upgrade Release Notes document isn’t available, that means that these are the latest available numbers for upgrade. This table lists the changes to this document. Table 1. Changes to this Document Date Description November 27, 2024 Release 10.5(2) became available. February 4, 2025 Fixed values for N9K-C93180YC-FX3H Introduction The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS mode switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. Cisco provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues. PLDs include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), but they do not include ASICs. In this document, the term EPLD is used for FPGA and CPLDs. The advantage of having EPLDs for some module functions is that when you need to upgrade those functions, you just upgrade their software images instead of replacing their hardware. Note: EPLD image upgrades for a line card disrupt the traffic going through the module because the module must power down briefly during the upgrade. The system performs EPLD upgrades on one module at a time, so at any one time the upgrade disrupts only the traffic going through one module. Cisco provides the latest EPLD images with each release. Typically, these images are the same as provided in earlier releases but occasionally some of these images are updated. These EPLD image updates are not mandatory unless otherwise specified. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, which upgrades the system image with no impact on the network environment. When Cisco makes an EPLD image upgrade available, these release notes announce their availability, and you can download the EPLD images from https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html . When choosing an EPLD version for upgrade, ensure you have already installed the corresponding NXOS software version first. It is generally not supported to upgrade to a newer EPLD image built for a future version of NXOS while running on an older NXOS version, unless explicitly supported as per the specific EPLD Release Notes. NXOS and EPLD images are labeled for their related version to avoid any unsupported upgrades. When to Upgrade EPLDs When new EPLD images are available, the upgrades are always recommended if your network environment allows for a maintenance period in which some level of traffic disruption is acceptable. If such a disruption is not acceptable, then consider postponing the upgrade until a better time. Note: The EPLD upgrade operation is a disruptive operation. Execute this operation only at a programmed maintenance time. The system ISSU upgrade is a nondisruptive upgrade. Note: Do not perform an EPLD upgrade during an ISSU system upgrade. Note: The EPLD version is backward compatible. The NXOS software can be downgraded for the switch and the EPLD version does not have to be downgraded to match the older NXOS version. Switch Requirements · The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch must be running the Cisco NX-OS operating system. · You must be able to access the switch through a console, SSH, or Telnet (required for setting up a switch running in NX-OS mode). · You must have administrator privileges to work with the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch. EPLD Upgrades Available for NX-OS Mode Releases 10.3(1) through 10.5(2) Each EPLD image that you can download from Software Download page is a bundle of EPLD upgrades packaged into a single EPLD image file. To see the available EPLD versions for the Nexus 9000 standalone and module switches on this release, see the tables. Note: All updates to an image are shown in boldface. If more than one release is shown for a column, the boldface applies to the first release listed for the column. Note: This release of EPLD addresses the Secure Boot Hardware Tampering vulnerability for Nexus 9000 Series switches.
